# AFRIFASHION1600: A Contemporary African Fashion Dataset for Computer Vision


`AFRIFASHION1600` is an openly accessible contemporary African fashion image dataset containing 1600 samples labelled into 8 classes representing some AFRICAN fashion styles.



Each sample is coloured and has an  image  size  of  128  x  128.   
This  is  a  niche dataset that aims to  improve visibility, inclusion, and familiarity of  African fashion in computer vision tasks.  
Though a small  dataset,  it  showed  encouraging  metrics  when  pre-trained deep learning models were used for image classification

While `AFRIFASHION1600` is a small dataset of only 1600 imagesin 8 distinct fashion item classes, We hope it can help demystify computer vision use cases for upcoming communities of Africans who are learning all about Artificial Intelligence and as a foundation that other interesting projects can be built one. 


`AFRIFASHION` was curated from openly available images online and is open-sourced but all images belong to the original copyright owners.
