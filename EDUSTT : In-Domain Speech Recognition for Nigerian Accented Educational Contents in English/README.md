Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR) has revolutionized and enabled interesting work with speech processing. Their application is diverse and domain-specific adaptations have increased their practical usefulness. In this work, we present EDUSTT, an in-domain speech to text model for education in Nigerian accent. Even though English is the official language used in teaching in Nigeria and there are several english speech to text models, EDUSTT is designed to account for varying speaking accents and technical related terms used in the classroom that are not in everyday words, The word error rate(WER) of the presented model is 27%, which is comparable to the WER of 25% common in commercial speech recognition APIs trained on regular English. EDUSTT is publicly available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-hDqiaUzeTvI-yay-pWElrf-fig5wBX-?usp=sharing).
