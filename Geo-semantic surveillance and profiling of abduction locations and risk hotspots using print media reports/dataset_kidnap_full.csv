20th February 2023,Australian archaeologist kidnapped in Papua New Guinea,"An Australian archaeologist and several others have been kidnapped for ransom in Papua New Guinea, the country’s prime minister said Monday, warning the armed captors “there is no place to hide.”
Police and government officials said a group including academics and guides from Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea were taken at gunpoint in the country’s rugged highlands early on Sunday.
The captors issued a ransom demand of roughly US$1 million and a 24-hour deadline, which has since been rescinded and the cash demand has dropped substantially.
Prime Minister James Marape said this was the first time such a ransom has been demanded.
 
The government is “treating this very, very seriously, we don’t want it to be a precedent for the future”, he said.
Papua New Guinea’s highlands are a sprawling expanse of jungle-cloaked hills where the central government and security forces have little sway.
In recent years, the regions have seen an increase in tribal warfare and modern weapons.

“I just want to inform those who are engaged in this one, there is no place to run, there is no place to hide in our country,” he said.
Local missionaries are said to be in contact with the captors and are negotiating the group’s release.
Australia’s government refused to comment publicly.

Our correspondent, during a visit to the affected community on Tuesday, observed residents, especially women and children fleeing the community over the fear of further attacks.

He added that the attackers also abducted six other young men and allegedly took them to a notorious shrine in Anaku community and that their whereabouts are still unknown.
He said, “Maduneke has been terrorising communities in Ayamelum, especially Omor community. When he arrived on Monday, February 6, with his gang members, many people in our community identified him because he is notorious for unleashing mayhem on people.

“The purpose of the meeting was to ensure that there was a lasting peace between Omor and Anaku. The meeting was fruitful, and we agreed to work together and do all that we can to ensure that there is peace, and that is why the attack on Monday came as a surprise to me.”
Chidume urged the state Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, as well as the state Commissioner of Police, Echeng Echeng, to act fast and bring the culprits to justice.
Reacting, Ifeanya, who also confirmed the attack, refuted the claim that the perpetrators were from Anaku community.        
He explained that Maduneke, who was linked to the attack, was not acting at the instance of the community, adding that a manhunt had been launched to arrest him so he could be handed to the law enforcement agency in the state.
He said, “Our community is also looking for him (Maduneke) everywhere to arrest him. Whenever we get hold of him, we will hand him over to the relevant agencies for necessary action. Our community and the whole of Ayamelum people are already tired of him.”

The situation has worsened security matters in the area that is yet to settle from the wanton killings by suspected herdsmen at Eha-Amufu, a neighbouring community.

On Monday, January 16, eight masked gunmen attacked five young men including the Chairman of Federated Ikem Improvement Union Enugu branch, Mr Emeka Odoh (aka Asokwa), as they concluded a security meeting in the neighbourhood.
 
Asokwa said he was home from Enugu to join other members of the committee to find ways to strengthen the local security ahead of the coming general elections so as to ensure that people will exercise their franchise in peace.
“As we drove out of the meeting venue, we found four gunmen on the main road brandishing guns.

Ikem-Isioroto is a strategic community on the northern border of Ikem. It is bounded by Benue State in the North and the routes to the rich farmlands have become a delight to kidnappers.

In each case, a ransom was paid before the victims were released.
Security agencies made some arrests and the suspects are still being investigated.
The suspects include Fulanis and their local collaborators The people are expecting quick prosecution of the suspects to serve as deterrence to others.
A journalist and native of the affected area, Anayochukwu Agbo, said that “The latest attack shows a dangerous trend. The gunmen were masked, unlike in previous kidnaps, suggesting heavier involvement of locals in the attack. The way they sacked the village suggests this could be a test run to what could happen during the coming elections.

 Our correspondent could not reach the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, Josephine Adeh, as of press time, as she said she was busy.
But reacting to the reports in an interview with our correspondent, the Chief Press Secretary, Federal Capital Territory Administration, Anthony Ogunleye, among other things, noted that the security situation in the FCT had improved in recent times.
Ogunleye said, “The issue of insecurity has reduced in the FCTA in recent times. The police and other security agencies are working hard, and the administration and the Minister have done so much to support them.
“The FCTA is doing so much. These bandits usually come from bordering states and they go back. If you noticed, the attacks usually occur in the outskirts bordering other states. However, there’s the inter-agency security committee that works in tandem with security outfits of bordering states, and they’ve been doing so much to dislodge bandits and kidnappers.”"

23rd December 2022,Gunmen kidnap Catholic priest in Benue,"Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have abducted a Catholic priest of Otukpo Diocese in Benue state, Rev. Father Mark Ojotu.

The abduction was confirmed by the diocese through a letter from the diocesan secretariat signed by the Chancellor, Rev. Fr. Joseph Itodo, and addressed to all priests, religious and lay faithful.
 
The letter read, “We write to notify you of the kidnap of one of our priests, Rev. Fr. Mark Ojotu.  Related News   PFN condemns murder of Niger Catholic priest  Lynched Catholic priest buried in Niger  Lynched priest: Police kill Niger protester, station burnt

“Incident confirmed and the command is on the trail of the priest and hoodlums involved,” Anene said in a terse message sent to our correspondent."
19th December 2022,"Counting kidnapped, killed Nigeria’s judges, lawyers","To survive in Nigeria’s legal profession these days, practitioners and judges require skills in the martial arts; nimbleness of feet on an Olympian scale; weapons handling; not to mention advanced training in subterfuge. Sadly, these are not offered on the curriculum of the Nigerian Law School nor in judicial orientation. Even with these skills reinforced by a wing and a prayer, being connected with the business of the legal process in Nigeria today is often life endangering.
In August 2015, Nigeria’s State Security Service announced that they had arrested members of a kidnapping syndicate who were about to abduct judges sitting on election petitions in Owerri, capital of Imo state. They named the leader of that syndicate as one Chibueze Henry, who went by the operational alias, Vampire. Charges followed against Vampire and his gang whose trial began in Owerri, the following year.
Now, the High Court in Owerri occupies a prominent piece of real estate, a shouting distance between the office of the State Governor and the headquarters of the Imo State Police Command. Entrance into the premises is controlled by gates, managed by security people who are public officials. In one of the court halls on this premises, the trial of Vampire and his gang was scheduled to continue on the morning of 27 January 2017.
As officials of the Nigeria Prison Service (as it was then called) drove into the court premises, a black Sports Utility Vehicle at the back of the convoy, sped past them, stopping suddenly. A horde of men armed with assault rifles jumped down from the SUV and started shooting indiscriminately. As judges, court personnel, lawyers, and court users scampered, the attackers liberated Vampire who fled along with up to 29 other detainees. The attack killed at least two persons, leaving many others injured.
 
Imo State, where this incident occurred, had been a site of targeted violence against judges and lawyers for over a decade. In March 2011, high court judges in the state embarked on a strike to protest the abduction of one their colleagues, Theophilus Nzekwe. He was not the first.
One year earlier, the judge-president of the state’s Customary Court of Appeal, Ambrose Egu; and senior Magistrate, Pauline Njemanze, were abducted near the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport near Owerri on official duties.
In 2009, Florence Duroha-Igwe, another judge of the Imo State High Court, suffered an attack in which both her driver and police orderly sustained severe gunshot injuries.
Emboldened by the absence of accountability, these attacks would grow in both frequency and brazenness. In October 2019, a senior Justice of Appeal from the state, Chioma Nwosu-Iheme, was abducted in Benin City, while on duty presiding over election disputes. She spent a fortnight in captivity.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
In September 2021, former Chief Judge of Abia State, Nnenna Oti, was abducted in Orlu, Imo State. Seven months earlier, the Presiding Justice of Appeal in Owerri, Rita Pemu, navigated the perils of abduction and possible assassination with an extra supply of native wiles.
Magistrate and court inspector, Oderachukwu Onumajulu, was not so lucky. As a child, Odera always desired to be a judge. In 2016, she climbed the first rung in her ambition when she was admitted to the Nigerian Bar. Three years later, she became a Magistrate in Imo State. On 22 May 2021, unidentified men shot and abducted Odera at the Customary Court of Appeal in Owerri, where she worked as court inspector. One month later, in June 2022, she died from her injuries.
Odera was the second judicial figure to be killed in the line of duty in the state in as many years. On 23 November, 2018, a body found dumped along Amucha Road in Njaba Local Government Area in Orlu Zone, Imo State, was identified as the remains of Remi Ogu, a Chief Magistrate in the neighbouring Oru LGA. Remi and his court registrar, Uju Nwanne, were abducted the previous day from their duty post. In March 2019, the police in the state paraded one Friday Nnaekezie, who claimed that he masterminded the abduction and killing of the Chief Magistrate.
Orlu zone, where Remi was killed, has become the epicentre of mass atrocities committed in the name of agitation. Three months before Remi’s murder, in August 2018, unidentified men incinerated the High Court and Magistrate’s court buildings in the city with all their records and archives. Four years later, on 17 December 2022, they returned to finish the job.
One of the more vocal voices at the Bar in Orlu was Darlington Odume, who became a lawyer in 2016. The community admired him for his fighting qualities, comparing him to the lion. So, they called him “Omekagu”. In mid-September 2021, while out procuring groceries for his household in Orlu, unidentified gunmen assassinated Omekagu. He was married to a policewoman in a location where it had become dangerous to be associated with one.  Related News   Women judges decry persistent female genital mutilation  Lawyers now cut corners, not interested in proving cases — Balogun, First female Lagos AG  Politicians, judges’ pay for review before June – RMAFC   
2021 was a particularly bad year for lawyers around the country. The month after Omekagu’s murder in Orlu, Ajah Ogbonna Ajah and another of his colleagues, both lawyers, were killed on the road by unidentified gunmen while on their way to court in Abakaliki, the capital of Ebonyi State in south-east Nigeria.
They were by no means the only victims in the region or in the year. In May, former High Court judge, Stanley Nnaji, died, assassinated by unknown persons on the streets of Enugu State.
In November 2021, seven unidentified men macheted to death Kenechukwu Okeke, in Nkpor, in Anambra State. They killed him in the presence of his wife and young daughter. Okeke, a lawyer, had been outspoken in his support of Nigeria’s ban on Twitter.
These killings of lawyers, magistrates, and judges were not limited to South-East Nigeria. On 17 February 2021, gunmen shot and killed Nkiru Agbasu, a pregnant lawyer, along the Warri-Sapele Road in Delta State.        
As in Imo State, Nkiru died in a state with a record of no consequences for the killing of lawyers. In March 2014, unidentified gunmen reportedly dressed in police uniforms assassinated two lawyers, Eguno Dafiaghor and Samuel Ekuwangi on the Azoro-Asaba motorway in Delta State. It was widely suspected that they “were murdered as a result of the high profile case they were handling at the High Court, Ozoro.”
A little over one year later, in April 2015, unidentified men executed the chair of the Nigerian Bar Association in Ughelli, Austin Icheghe, in his residence in front of his family and without consequences.
Impunity also explains insecurity among lawyers in Abuja, Nigeria’s Federal Capital. In October 2013, the police found the mutilated remains of Ijeoma Micah in her law office in upmarket Maitama, in Abuja. She had been missing for three days.
Seven years later, Ben Okpe, another lawyer, was killed near his home in Karu, near Abuja. In March, 2022, terrorists who hijacked the Abuja-Kaduna train, killed Farida Sule Mohammed, a young Abuja lawyer. She was 29. Suleiman Zailani, was killed in August; Sadiq Gaya in September. At the end of November, unidentified gunmen in the Federal Capital assassinated senior lawyer, Steven Eke, in the presence of his wife and son.
Feyitayo Obot was killed in her hotel room when she travelled to Lagos on professional business at the end of January 2019; nearly two months after the killing of Adeshina Adeola, who was killed on the outskirts of Abuja in the week of his admission to Nigerian Bar in November 2018.
The killings and abductions of lawyers and judges recounted here are only a fraction of the story. Three things are clear about them. First, the perpetrators nearly always get away with it. Second, any society that tolerates these kinds of attacks on its courts, judges, and lawyers is lawless. Third, the NBA does not yet have a focused program for ensuring accountability for these attacks on lawyers and judges. That is the first thing that needs to change.

Reacting to the report, a security expert, Oladele Fajana, said the spread of insecurity in the country posed a threat to the successful census and general elections in the country.
He said, “It is a bad development. We all know that insecurity has affected every aspect of our economy and having it in that number of local government areas affirms the saying that nowhere is safe in the country.
“This may affect the 2023 elections and census. With our reactionary approach and the size of security operatives, we may not be able to stop it from spreading. To me, the decentralisation of the policing system remains one of the ways to solve the problem.”
Colonel Saka Foluso (retd.) blamed insecurity in the local government areas on the inexistence of the administration at the level in the country.
He said, “There is no way it (insecurity) will not affect the election. Already there are fears among Nigerians, except the security agencies raise to the occasion.”"
10th December 2022,"Sit-at-home: Gunmen kill four, kidnap expatriates in Imo","Gunmen enforcing sit-at-home on Friday evening killed four persons at two locations on Owerri-Okigwe Road in Imo State.

8th December 2022,"Kidnappers kill two, abduct eight, FCT residents tackle police","Two residents have been confirmed killed after suspected kidnappers attacked the Extension 2 Relocation, along Arab Road, in the Kubwa area of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.
Eight residents, including a member of the National Youth Service Corps, identified only as Adenike, were reportedly abducted by the hoodlums.
PUNCH Metro gathered that Adenike was abducted in her father’s house.
A source said, “Adenike, the landlord’s only daughter who’s currently doing her NYSC, was kidnapped. Seven others were kidnapped alongside Adenike. We’re confused now because several people are also missing.”
 
During the attack, an eyewitness, who reached out to our correspondent through a distress call, said the gunmen shot sporadically on Amilomania Street and later moved to Toyin Street.
He said, “We heard gunshots twice when they first stormed a house on Amilonania Street. They’re now on Toyin Street, at the last house by the hill.
“They shot a tailor, Abel, popularly known as Oshodi, and he’s lying down dead. They also shot another male, but we have taken him to the Kubwa General Hospital at Phase 4; he’s unconscious. The gunmen escaped through the hill.”   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
The FCT Police Command said it had commenced investigation into the attack.
The Commissioner of Police, Sunday Babaji, noted that the swift response of operatives of the command resulted in the rescue of three victims and recovery of firearms and ammunition, including one AK-47 rifle and 25 rounds of ammunition.
The command’s spokesperson, Josephine Adeh, in a statement obtained by our correspondent on Wednesday, said preliminary investigation revealed that around 7.30pm on December 6, some armed criminals entered the estate and shot two people — one Abel, popularly known as Oshodi, and one Abdulwahab.
She said, “The suspects, while departing the scene, left with four victims, possibly to enable them to evade arrest by the approaching police response team deployed in the area for quick intervention.

“The two gunshot victims were immediately rushed to a hospital for medical attention. Unfortunately, one of them, Oshodi, could not survive as he was confirmed dead by a doctor, while Abdulwahab is still being attended to.”
However, some residents slammed the police command for claiming that it rescued three victims.
The residents said the police only showed up hours after the gunmen had abducted eight people, including the corps member.        
“The police didn’t rescue anyone among the kidnap victims. Only one young man escaped, as he struggled with the gunmen and fled,” a resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.
Another resident, who asked to be identified as Tunde for security reasons, said none of the victims was rescued.
“We are still looking for eight persons,” he added.

Boboi said, “Abdullahi is also dead. He died this morning at a hospital in Gwagwalada. We rushed him to the Kubwa General Hospital alongside Abel, who was declared dead on arrival, but the hospital didn’t have adequate equipment to resuscitate him while he was unconscious, so we took him to Gwagwalada, where he was placed on an oxygen device, but later gave up the ghost this morning.
“About seven to eight persons were kidnapped, but none of them have been rescued. Only one escaped last night (Tuesday) out of the nine that were abducted.”
Boboi said the community needed a police post, adding that the local vigilantes hired to secure the community were incapable.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

2nd November 2022,Gunmen kidnap 39 children on Katsina farm,"Gunmen have kidnapped nearly 40 children working on a farm in northwest Nigeria and demanded ransom for their release, police and a local official said on Wednesday.
Dozens of gunmen on motorcycles stormed a farm outside Mairuwa village in Faskari district of Katsina State on Sunday and rounded up 39 children who were harvesting crops for a fee, the police and the official said.
Katsina is one of several states in northwest and central Nigeria that are terrorised by criminal gangs, locally known as called bandits, who raid villages, killing and abducting residents as well as looting and burning homes.
Hostages are usually released after ransom payment to the gangs, who reputedly hole up in the vast Rugu forest straddling Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger States.
 
“Bandits invaded a farm in Mairuwa and took away underaged labourers working on the farm,” said Gambo Isah, Katsina police spokesman.
“Our personnel have mobilised to the area with the mission to rescue the hostages and apprehend the criminals,” Isah said, without providing further details.
A Faskari local government official said the bandits rode into the farm on motorbikes as scores of labourers were working.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
“The adult workers who could run much faster managed to escape but 39 children who could not outrun the bandits were caught,” said the official, who asked not to identified for personal safety.  Related News   236 Nigerians killed in three months  FCTA equips security agencies with new gadgets  Buhari promises to rid country of insecurity before leaving   
Thirty-three of the hostages, boys and girls, were from Mairuwa village and the other six were from nearby villages, he said.
He said the bandits used the telephone of one of the hostages to make a ransom demand.
The farm manager had previously struck a deal with the bandits, who demanded protection money to let the harvest go ahead and were given a down payment, the official said.
“It is obvious the bandits were angry that work began on the farm without being settled the balance,” the source said.
Faskari, which lies on the border with Zamfara State, faces recurrent threats of kidnapping by bandits crossing into the area from their forest camps, said the official.
The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has been under pressure to tackle security challenges before he leaves office next year after two four-year terms, the maximum permitted under the constitution.        
Africa’s most populous country, Nigeria, is grappling with bandit gangs in the north-western and central regions, terrorism in the northeast and separatist agitation in the southeast.

Some people who wanted to escape were hit by bullets. It was terrible and not a good experience at all, but all thanks to God.

We were moving in the bush for several hours; they did not give us water or food. We were licking water on leaves inside the forest.
For the two days I spent with them, we were moving around the forest, we don’t stay too long in one place before they move us to another place.
They did not have a house or anywhere to hide us. We sleep wherever the night meets us; we were sleeping inside the forest for two days. Some of us will sleep on trees, while others will sleep on the grass.        
Any attempt to escape? 
We can’t attempt to escape because since two guys escaped on the first night, they changed their strategy. They always surround us, so, there is no way we can make any attempt.
We used to hear the voices of people because most of the places we were sleeping belong to farmers. We saw cassava, maize, and other plantations inside the forest.
When our abductors discovered that we are hearing the voices of neighbouring villagers, they will move us to another place.
Do you know the identity of your abductors? 
Yes, they were Hausas but they understand and speak Yoruba fluently. Many of them are young, some can’t be more than 15 or 16 years old. They were carrying guns like AK 47.
They were speaking Yoruba, but they are Hausas. They don’t understand any other language apart from Yoruba and Hausa. If they hear us speak English, they will beat us.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
How were you treated?
We were really maltreated; they beat the hell out of us. The men suffered the most because they put ropes around their necks and were dragging them around.
I was not really maltreated because when I told them my name is Aminat, they said: “you are a Muslim, and we are worshipping the same, Allah.”
We were over 20 that were kidnapped and some were even killed inside the forest.

I can never pass through that road again in my life. Even if I want to go for my NYSC, I won’t go by road. I will rather take the plane to any location I am posted to. Government needs to help us do something about that road.
How many people remained with them after your ransom was paid?   
I can’t say but I know we left a lot of people there; they only released those that paid.
Many people were injured, some were shot in the head, and there was no one to treat them.
They did not give us any food or water. The kidnappers didn’t eat as well, all they ate was raw cassava, they will just uproot it, peel it and eat it like that.
Policeman advised me to negotiate with kidnappers  ­— Victim’s father
Kayode Taiwo, the father of Aminat Taiwo who was kidnapped and released along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway spoke to SODIQ OJUROUNGBE about how he was able to secure the release of his daughter after paying the ransom.
How did you hear about the kidnapping of your daughter and what did you do?
It was around 10 pm on Friday that Aminat’s sister rushed to inform me that she received a call that her sister was kidnapped.
Immediately she told me that, we started calling her number but she was not picking up. After about an hour, we called the number again but it was picked up by a Hausa man this time.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
Very early on the second day, I went to the Mowe police station to report the case; they asked me to bring money that they want to embark on tracking, I gave them money. After they tracked whatever they were tracking, they gave me a paper to take to Owode police station. When I got to Owode police station, the DPO said he cannot collect the paper from me because it is not in his jurisdiction. He said I should go back and give it to the police officer in Mowe and that they should be the ones to bring it to him.
I discovered that the Police were not ready to do anything. People suggested I go to Amotekun but when I got to them, they said they cannot do anything without the go-ahead from the Mowe DPO.
At that point, I gave up on the police and started praying that the kidnappers should call and discuss how to pay them.
The kidnapper called me on Saturday night and I heard my daughter’s voice begging me to look for money that I should not allow them to kill her because they were killing people at the place.
The man demanded that I should look for N10m but I told him I don’t have such an amount of money, and he cut the call.
Around 6 am on Sunday, my daughter called me again crying, I told her that all I can raise is N2m.
After some time, the man called me back and told me that we should bring the N2m to Ibadan. I asked him where, and he said when I get to Ibadan by 2 pm, he will call me.        
When we started posting about the fundraising, someone called me and said he will borrow me 3,000 dollars. The person gave me the 3,000 dollars, I was happy that everything has been sorted but when I got to the Aboki where I was supposed to change the money, I discovered that it was fake.
We started afresh, we started looking for money, sourcing for money, and with assistance from Nigerians, friends and family, I was able to raise the N2m before 2 pm.
How do you meet the kidnappers? 
I got to Tollgate Ibadan and called the man, he asked me to come back to Onigarri. I went back to Onigarri but they asked me to turn and come back to Ibadan. I did this about two times before they asked me to wait for them around Dominion University. They asked if I am with Police, and I told them I did not bring anybody except my younger brother.
I waited for them around Dominion University for more than 30 minutes before they called me and asked if I can come to them. I told them I can come so far it is to save my daughter. They asked me to turn back at the front of Dominion University and I saw them putting on soldiers’ uniforms. They were about 10 and I was able to see the chained victims from afar.
They asked how much I brought, and I told them it was N3.2m, they asked if it was complete, and I told them it was.
Your view on Nigeria’s security apparatus?    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
There is no security in Nigeria at all. None of the police officers that I went to meet was able to assist me. One of the bosses told me that I should just negotiate with them and insist on N2m."

Chidibere Uzor are true and patriotic sons of Onicha Igboeze, and I am vehemently convinced that one cannot plan any evil for the other irrespective of differences in their party ideologies and practices.
“Information on public space has it that Hon.

For more information, one can contact the NDLEA office at Abakaliki.”

19th September 2022,Bandits kidnap three Kaduna farmers,"Bandits ravaging the Kurgi Gabas community in the western part of Birnin-Gwari area in Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State, have killed a motorcyclist and abducted scores of travellers along the Birnin-Gwari, Funtua Road.
The terrorists were said to have blocked the Birnin-Gwari, Funtua Road, trapping no fewer than 30 vehicles and looting occupants’ loads.
The drivers or owners were reportedly forced to pay between N300, 000 and N1m to the terrorists before they could retrieve their vehicles.
 The Chairman of the Birnin-Gwari Emirate Progressives Union, Ishaq Kasai, disclosed this in a statement released in Kaduna on Sunday.
 
 He said, “On Thursday, September 15, 2022, bandits kidnapped three locals at farms in Kurgin Gabas community in the Western part of Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
 “The bandits also invaded the same community on Friday snatched a motorcycle and killed the owner (Bala Balansi) before going back to the forest.  Related News   Again, bandits invade Benue community, kill eight villagers  Bandits attack Kaduna communities, security operatives feared killed  Bandits attack Plateau community, kill village head, others   
 “Kurgin Gabas is sharing a border with Kamuku Forest Reserve which has become the main hideout of armed bandits from which the bandits usually come out to carry out attacks in communities in the Western part of Birnin-Gwari and the neighbouring Rafi LGA of Niger State.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
 “BEPU acknowledges that the security level at Birnin-Gwari to Kaduna Highway has improved following the earlier visit by GOC of 1 Div Kaduna and subsequent mobilisation of troops as well as occasional aerial surveillance along the road by security agencies.
 “However, BEPU is deeply concerned that Birnin-Gwari/Funtua highway remains blocked by armed bandits whereby about 30 vehicles including big trucks are trapped and are yet to be retrieved by owners; and many of the travellers abducted during the attack on September 1, 2022 are yet to be released.
 “Another disturbing scenario is that the bandits have carted away all the loads/goods contained in the trapped vehicles and people were forced by the bandits to pay huge amounts of money ranging from N300,000 to N1,000,000 to retrieve their trapped vehicles. The charge disparity depends on the size and nature of the vehicles.”
 The union appealed for the mobilisation of troops to ensure the opening of the Birnin-Gwari-Funtua road and for retrieving the trapped vehicles unconditionally.
 “The union believes that opening of the road and sustained surveillance will help in addressing the problem of attacks on travellers and in bringing permanent peace as well as enhancing business and other economic activities in Birnin-Gwari LGA.”"
17th September 2022,How teenagers kidnapped me on Lagos-Ibadan Long Bridge – Photographer,"A 24-year-old photographer, Olabode Adekunle, shares with GODFREY GEORGE his experience in the hands of kidnappers who abducted him along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway after his vehicle had a flat tyre  
What is your name?
My name is Olabode Adekunle. I live in Magboro, Ogun State. I am 24 years old. I am a photographer.
There was a report that you were kidnapped along the Long Bridge stretch of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Is this true?
 
Yes, this is very true. I was kidnapped by Fulani men along the bridge, very close to the Mikano factory on Tuesday (September 6, 2022). It happened around 3.45am or so that morning.
What were you doing out that early in the morning?
My brother, who was travelling abroad, and I were trying to beat the traffic. You know how terrible the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway has been these past months. If one had to arrive at the airport at 7am, one had to leave before 4am. It is terrible. So, I was the one driving one of the cars. Another brother of mine was driving another, in which my brother who was travelling was.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
What happened then?
Everything happened very fast, I must say. I was driving and one of the tyres of the car I was driving just burst. It happened close to Mikano factory. Before I got to that spot, there was a ghastly motor crash there, and the person with me in the car and I were still talking about it when the tyre burst. Some police officers were even around the spot. It was just like a dream, honestly. The guys were fast. It was not even up to five minutes and the Fulani guys just came out and attacked us and abducted me.
Before then, I had just come down from the car – a Toyota Highlander (2006) – to see how we could change the tyre or manage it till we could change it. Before I got down, I was telling the person beside me how I thought it was a bad idea to have stopped there. After I checked and entered the car, the Fulani guys just attacked us. There were about three of them at first. So, while I was struggling with them, another one joined them and the guy beside me ran because the attackers came from the driver’s side. I couldn’t overpower them alone as they were hitting me and pushed me down from the bridge and I landed on the ground where others were waiting to collect me. When I found myself in that position, I just told myself that the end had come. I couldn’t struggle with them from that position again. That was how they took me inside the bush. We walked for like two hours on foot inside the swamp and through the water till we got to their hideout which is an uncompleted building with a decking.
The boys who attacked me are very young boys – teenagers! The oldest of them, from my assessment, would not be more than 23 years old.
How did you ascertain they were Fulani people?
They were Fulani people. If they were not, I wouldn’t say so. They spoke their language and they also communicated with clicks just the same way they talk to their cows.
Did they have their cows there with them?        
No, they didn’t but with the way they behaved and the way they spoke, it was crystal clear they were Fulani people. They had the demeanour of the pastoralist and it is not something I would just make up.
For how long were you with them?
We were there for about the entire day. They didn’t speak to me or say anything. They didn’t even say I was kidnapped or what they wanted. They just stared at me and smoked all manner of hard drugs. It was such a horrible sight to watch these young people destroy their lives with drugs! After an hour, one of them came to meet me and asked me if I was the one travelling, and I told them I was only accompanying my brother who was travelling. They didn’t believe me so they insisted that I was the one travelling because, according to them, they saw the bags in the car. They also asked if I was a police officer. I said I wasn’t. They said a lot of police officers were looking for me. I said I wasn’t an officer. It angered them and they brought out their whip and began to beat me. It was merciless! They beat me with the stick they use to herd their cows; you can’t even imagine that kind of torture.
After they were satisfied with the torture, they then told me that they had kidnapped me and I had to bail myself with a ransom of N100m. I was taken aback. I told them that there was no way I could afford that so, and they reduced the ransom to N30m. I told them I couldn’t afford that either. So, they asked me what I could afford, and I said I could afford N2m. They said it was N10m they wanted, and it was final. They threatened to resume the beating, but I begged that even if they killed me, there was no way my family would be able to produce that amount of ransom. So, one of them told me that I would not be able to reach out to my family till after six days. I was silent because I was too tired.

Did you sleep there?
Of course, I did on the bare floor with a dirty wrapper they provided. But what choice did I have? I slept there till the next day (Wednesday, September 7, 2022). At around 8am, they told me to pack and follow them. They left the building and went deeper into the bush. They pitched their tent and mosquito net. They carried bags which contained all they needed so it was not difficult for them at all. It was as though they lived on the road. I guess they must have sensed that they might be traced there. We waited till around, say, 2pm, before they gave me the phone to call my family. Before they gave me the phone, they gave me another round of beating, perhaps, to instil fear in me, so I would be shivering when I call my family. They also warned me not to disclose the location I was. I called my parents and told them what had happened. Then, I told them I was at Kara. I spoke in Yoruba. Immediately they heard ‘Kara’, they took the phone from me, hung up and slapped me. I told them I didn’t know when I said so.
Later on, they told me they were armed robbers who were not scared of death. They threatened that if my parents did not bring the money, they would transfer me to a place called Mafia and to Zaria. They later said my family should take the ransom money to Ilorin.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
How much did they collect as ransom in the end?
After they saw that there was no way in the world I could afford N10m, they reduced it to N3m. My family begged them for N2m, but they said even if they collected the N2m, they would still kill me. One of them said I should pray to my God because it was only Him who could save me from their hands. I was so scared. He kept saying he would collect that ransom and kill or transfer me to the Mafia. At around 8pm, we left that place and went back to the uncompleted building barefoot, where they told me to negotiate with my family. My people told them that the money was ready. They then said they should buy suya (roasted meat), cartons of tin milk and malt drink; packs of cigarettes and lighter when they were bringing the ransom. As we waited, no minute passed without them smoking hard drugs. I was so scared for my life.
Were they armed?
One of them had a gun. The rest had knives, daggers and other weapons. This is something they do often and they were prepared. They attacked us like experts. Those guys know every part of that bush. They didn’t walk like they were confused. They had left footprints so they knew exactly where they were going in that forest. When they wanted to release me, I overheard one of them talking to one of their colleagues on the phone, and they were mentioning names of ‘streets’ they have carved out in the forest. I heard one say something like, “We dey Zaria Road”. With this, it is clear they know every part of that bush.
Did you eat anything?
They gave me that their garri that has onions inside and water. That was all I ate.
How did you regain freedom?  
I had even lost hope; I had resigned to fate that I would die there because I didn’t hear anything from my family and I thought they couldn’t come up with the money as they had promised. They just told me to follow them and it looked like they were heading out. I think one of them had gone to collect the money. They called him ‘Sergeant’. The others were called ‘officers’. The money was brought to the uncompleted building, I guess, before I was allowed to go. There was one of them there who understood Yoruba well, but he was also Fulani because he also communicated in Fulfulde. That one is the devil among them. He was ruthless. He was a very young boy but his heart is dark and it didn’t look like he cared about humanity at all.
They just took me to a part of the road and I met their boss. He was the one who told me that my family loves me and they have given them the money. They asked me to clear my iPhone but I didn’t log out on iCloud. So, it is still active on that phone and can be tracked. They returned my SIM card and told me to call my family to meet me at Fagbems Filling Station, around OPIC.
Did they drop you off there?
No, they didn’t do that. They simply led me to a bush path and told me to walk straight through the water path till I see Fagbems. That was what I did. Before I knew it, I could see the block industry. It was not up to 30 minutes before I got to the bus stop. One of them was kind enough to give me N3,000 as transport fare. This was around 3.40am when I checked my iPhone to clear it on their instruction.
How have you coped with the trauma?
Honestly, this Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is a deadly road. It is not new that that place has become a den of ruthless terrorists. I messed up big time! I shouldn’t have stopped when the tyre went flat. I should have managed it. Stopping was the window I gave them. I have had a similar experience on that bridge before when these same terrorists came out to rob passengers during traffic. I had to run for my life. I jumped down from the bus that day and ran. I was driving this time and there was nothing I would have done.
Did you report this to the police when you regained the freedom, to share your experience?   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
Yes, I have, together with my family. The car was even parked at the police station before we bailed it. It was my dad’s car I drove, not mine. The terrorists had broken the glass that day. Everyone should just be cautious on that road especially at night and early in the morning. If you have a flat tyre, just keep moving. If the car is bad, leave it and run as fast as your legs can carry you till you get to safety. It has now become a deathtrap."

This was after the General Officer Commanding, One Division, Nigerian Army, Kaduna, Major General Taoreed Lagbaja, led troops on an onslaught of terrorists in the Birnin-Gwari general areas on Wednesday 31st August 2022.
However, the Chairman of the Birnin-Gwari Emirate Progressives Union, Ishaq Kasai, said on Monday, that the terrorists relocated to the Birnin-Gwari to Funtua road where they blocked the area and killed a commercial driver and abducted several travelers. 
According to him, the road is still inaccessible by travellers. Insecurity is worsening along Birnin-Gwari to Funtua road and in many communities, particularly in the Eastern part of the Local Government. 
 
He said that most communities along that road such as Kwasa-kwasa, Marabar Kwasa-kwasa, Nacibi, Farin Ruwa among others, were being deserted for fear of any eventuality.
He added, “Again, the Armed bandits attacked Damari community on Tuesday 3rd September 2022 by 10:00 pm where one person was killed and shops looted. This came after the people who were sacked by armed bandits earlier in August have started returning to the community.
“Layin Lasan Community was also attacked by the same armed bandits in the evening on Sunday  4th September 2022 where scores of residents were kidnapped and moved to neighbouring forests. Various communities are continued to be attacked by armed bandits silently and unreported.”   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});       Related News   
Kasai, therefore, said there was need for mobilization of troops to the Western part of Birnin-Gwari, particularly in the Kakangi and Randagi axis which shares boundaries with Zamfara and Niger States. 
While appreciating and commending the renewed effort of the Government and the gallant troops, the BEPU chairman, appealed for an extension of the operation to the terrorists’ hideouts in the forests for restoration of peace for people to live in their communities without fear and intimidation. 
He noted that this was also necessary in order to provide opportunity for conduct of 2023 general elections in the area and for the people to exercise their election franchise. 
He said, “The Union witnessed that the new General Officer Commandant (GOC) of 1 Division of the Nigerian Army Kaduna personally led a team of gallant troops and went on ground surveillance on Wednesday 31st August 2022 through Kaduna to Birnin-Gwari and Birnin-Gwari to Funtua roads respectively where some successes were recorded including neutralizing and arresting of some bandits who were intercepted in some communities around the roads. 
“The effort is commendable and we sincerely appreciate and commend the Government and the Nigerian troops for this achievement and renewed move in combating insecurity in the area.
“It gladdens the Union to observe that more security personnel are mobilized around Kaduna to Birnin-Gwari road. This is significantly reducing tension and is a welcomed move towards addressing the problem of persistent attacks on travellers on the Birnin-Gwari to Kaduna road.
“Regrettably, BEPU observes that the Armed bandits blocked Birnin-Gwari to Funtua road following the earlier surveillance by the GOC and his team. The bandits blocked the road since Thursday, 1st September, 2022 which coincides with Birnin-Gwari Market Day, killed a commercial driver and kidnapped scores of travellers who are yet to be freed. The road is still a no-transit zone.”"

The man is said to have a private clinic where he treats patients from the communities in the area.

An account noted that the gunmen suspected to be Fulani invaded his clinic at around 9pm on Friday and whisked him away, while another version indicated that he was waylaid on the highway and taken away by his captors.

24th April 2022,"We were kidnapped by southerners in Delta, handed over to Fulani for ransom negotiation  – Bayelsa-based journalist","Bayelsa-based freelance journalist, Julius Osahon, who recently regained freedom from kidnappers’ den, tells ADEYINKA ADEDIPE about the scary experience
What are the events that led  to your kidnap?
I must say that I had no premonition that such could happen to me. But when the kidnap happened, it all looked like something I had dreamt about before, especially the shooting and killing of the driver. It felt like it was happening in a movie. Actually on that day, I was supposed to leave Bayelsa for Delta State by 3pm but I shifted it to 4pm. On my way to the park, I saw a bus belonging to Sunny Ero Motors, which took me to the park where I boarded the bus going to Warri. So, I got my ticket but it took a while for the bus to fill up. For the first time, I didn’t write my name in the manifest because I got my ticket from the first park where I boarded the bus. But some things happened, like people coming into the bus and alighting because of one reason or another. I kept faith in God, believing that I would get to my destination without any hiccup. We left Yenagoa around 5pm and I expected I should be at my destination by 7pm. I was also sure of arriving at my destination safely; there had been no kidnapping on that route for a while. I am surprised to have been kidnapped.
Do you think leaving late contributed to your kidnap?
 
I don’t think so. We were kidnapped around 6pm when the day was still bright. I was thinking we should arrive in Ughelli soon but we were attacked and kidnapped five minutes’ drive to Ughelli. When we were leaving the park, there was another bus loading after the one I boarded and going towards the same direction we were going. It was a random thing and we were unfortunate to be there at that time.
There were almost 15 police checkpoints that we passed before we were kidnapped. The last one we passed was just one or two minutes before we were abducted. I have learnt my lessons, the moment it is after 4pm, I will never leave for a trip again, no matter how short.
Can you explain how the kidnap took place?   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
I was making a call to my sister to wish her a happy birthday but her phone was not reachable as we passed a village called Uwelli. So I called my sister’s friend so she could let her know I was going to stay with her till the following day before travelling further. It was at this point that I started hearing gunshots. It was like I was in a trance. All I noticed was that we all lay down in the bus trying to avoid being hit by bullets. It was a war situation. Two other passengers were lying on me. The first thing I saw was a man shooting in the air. He then pointed the gun at the driver and shot him dead. The driver’s blood started flowing to where I was and even stained my phone. But my phone was still on and I was sure that my sister’s friend heard all the commotion that took place. The kidnappers just came out from the bush and hell was let loose.
How many of you were taken into the bush?
They took about seven or eight of us from the bus. Two boys, who sat at the back, escaped, I suppose, through the window. They also kidnapped people from two Sienna buses that were behind us, one from Port Harcourt and another had a man and his wife. Initially they separated us. Immediately, they took our wallets, phones (which they switched off) and other personal effects. They couldn’t switch off my phone and they put it in airplane mode. They took us through a bush path and I was the one who carried all the things they took from us, which was added burden. After about 10 minutes walk into the bush, I heard police siren and gunshots and we diverted into a thick forest that was waterlogged and they told us to lie face down. They instructed that nobody should talk. After about an hour of lying face down in the water and they were sure the police had gone, they told us to stand up, by which time, it was dark and it was difficult to see who was beside you.
We started walking, not knowing where we were going. I had lost my leather slippers during the initial commotion and I was walking barefoot. It was horrible because we didn’t know what we were stepping on. They used the torchlight from a small phone to find their way and ours was to follow them. They didn’t care about any discomfort any of us was going through. If you were not keeping with the pace, they hit you with the butt of the gun or beat you with a stick. When you also tried to break a small tree branch impeding you, they will think you intended to use it as a weapon and they would beat you. So, I had no choice but to move on no matter what was impeding me. I sustained several cuts on my arms. After several hours, we got to a spot where we were again told to lie face down.
They called us one after the other, asking us where we worked and other personal questions. It was like profiling us to see what they could get as ransom. They then separated us because they felt that there were some people they would not get money from even if they threatened to kill them. Those ones were thoroughly beaten and there were some female students who were released the next day.
What did the kidnappers look like?
The people who kidnapped us were southerners but they handed us us to Fulani or Hausa-Fulani (men) in the bush, who made sure we did not escape while the negotiation was on. It was obvious that the Fulani knew the forest so well.        
How did the news of your kidnap get to town?
A lady who sat beside me in the bus was one of the persons released the next day and she was the one who broke the news at the Nigeria Union of Journalists’ secretariat in Yenagoa. She lives in my area and she is an up-and-coming artist. I had even done stories about her. It was when I got out that I was told they were released 3am the following day and they got to a farm settlement after running for hours. The farmers called their parents to come pick them in the morning. After the news was broken, stories were done about the incident, with special focus on me. It was when I got released that I knew all that my colleagues did.
The kidnappers first demanded N3m to free you but later raised it to N30m because they thought you were popular. How did that make you feel?
Actually, I didn’t know anything about this until I was released. I didn’t even know that our kidnap was in the news. My only prayer was to leave that place in one piece. When they asked for my job, I told them I was a freelance/human rights journalist, who didn’t get paid. They could not understand why I didn’t get paid, so I explained further that freelance journalism is only profitable abroad. I told them I write stories about the underprivileged. One of the kidnappers slapped me twice, asking me what I meant by working as a freelance journalist and not getting paid. He told me that if their master confirmed I was lying, they were going to beat the hell out of me. As I was answering their questions, they were beating me, though it was mild. On the second night, they took us to another part of the forest. On that first night, we walked for about four hours before we got the spot we spent the first night. The following morning we were blindfolded and our hands were tied. You could not kill the ants when they were biting you. We had to endure. The suffering was too much and there was no food or water. One of them took pity on us and removed the blindfold and untied our hands. That second night was the worst because we had to walk several hours. Whenever they perceived danger, they moved us to another part of the forest. But in the morning, we stayed in a place; I guess they were afraid of being spotted. Once in a while, they brought a loaf of bread for eight of us but I couldn’t eat bread without water. So, I drank water whenever it was available and that was the only thing I survived on.  Related News   Gunmen kidnap nine in Abuja estate  Zamfara police rescue 14 kidnap victims held 68 days  Four Nasarawa pupils rescued after 14-day captivity   
How did you negotiate your release?
On the first day in captivity, they didn’t ask for anything; they just kept us there. However, on the second day, one of them came and said what he needed was money. They gave us our phones to contact anyone that could pay for our release. So, I told them my wife was the only one I could contact. When I called her, they threatened that they would kill me if they didn’t get money. I didn’t know the number of some other people who could help raise some money. So, I checked my Facebook, got a number of a close friend in Lagos, who I called and they threatened him too, asking for the kind of relationship between us. He told them we were friends. I tried to link my friend up with my wife but it failed; so, it was left for my wife to negotiate my release. Whoever didn’t know the phone number of their wife or husband was beaten. Some other persons also used my phone to call their relatives. Unfortunately, my phone went off on the third day. And because of this, one of the kidnappers was beating me but another told him that I could not be blamed for the phone that went off because most of the people were using my phone to call their people. I even told them I could transfer some money to my wife so she could add to whatever she could raise for the ransom payment. So, one of them gave me his small phone, which I put my SIM card into to call my wife again. They even instructed my wife to send recharge card to the phone. The ransom kept changing. They could ask for N5m this minute and something higher the next minute. So, we were all negotiating and begging. They told me to pay N30m the day negotiation started. The second day, another person came and demanded N50m. It was then I suspected that the news had got out. Luckily for me, one of those kidnappers called me aside, told me to calm down and also urged my wife to be calm. He also saved me from beating. They slapped one guy beside me and I was crying thinking mine was going to be more than that but he only hit the back of my ear. I made sure that my wife was the only one involved in the negotiation and I told her to sell everything in the house to raise some money. She complied while telling them what she had been able to gather. They would cock their gun to let her know they were serious and she would start crying, making me emotional too and I would also cry.
I know what we have been through. I have worked for several years without getting paid. Sometimes, we live from hand to mouth. I am only able to pay my children’s school fees by God’s grace. I am suffering and I am just trying to make ends meet. I don’t have any pension and my wife will suffer if anything bad happens to me. These were some of the thoughts that gave me great concern while in captivity. So, I was begging them to accept N1m and when my wife said she was able to raise N1.5m, I was surprised and never believed it. I must thank my friends.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
What effort did the Nigeria Union of Journalists in Bayelsa make to help raise money?
Through the effort of the NUJ in Bayelsa, a commissioner sent money to my wife as part of the ransom but she still had to feed our children. I don’t think my kids know what it means to be kidnapped even if they know, would you tell them they cannot feed? So after agreeing on what to pay, they said the Friday I regained my freedom was the final day to pay ransom and that anyone that did not pay would be killed.
How was the ransom delivered to the kidnappers?
My wife confirmed to the kidnappers she had N1.5m. By then, one of my brothers, who lives in Auchi, had come over to my house in Benin but I kept him out of the negotiation because it could spell doom. In fact, they rejected the N1.5m, saying it was too small and told my wife that if she didn’t make effort to get more money she would have to spend that N1.5m for my burial. She just kept pleading with them.  After accepting her plea, they told her to go and collect the money in the bank that night, which was impossible. On Friday morning, she went to an ATM; she was debited but the machine did not dispense the money, which created more problem. She filled the complaint form in the bank but couldn’t get a reversal. So, she left for Warri with what she had and a good neighbour of my sister lent her the N500, 000 balance. My wife almost died on the Friday because of the stress she went through. My brother brought the ransom to the place they instructed.
What time were you released on that Friday?
After confirming the receipt of the money, they called four of us from where we were lying face down and said we were free to go at about 8pm. They gave us a bottle of water each. Two of them volunteered to take us to a bush path which they told us would take us straight to a village.
How did the villagers receive you?  
We were all tired and thirsty, so we approached one of the villagers for water and somewhere to rest. After giving us water, we explained what we went through but he did believe us and he invited vigilantes who accused the four of us of being armed robbers. We asked them to check our profile online but there was no smart phone. So, one man volunteered to use his tricycle to help us reach some people but instead he brought in more vigilantes with guns. Fortunately, for us, a retired Deputy Superintendent of Police came and interrogated us. He took us to his house, gave us bread and soft drinks. He called the DPO of the nearest police station and my brother and other who were waiting for us in Ughelli. So our people came down to Eyede and we went to the police station where we wrote our statements and were allowed to leave few minutes before 12 midnight.
In a news report, the police claimed the glory for your release. What’s your take?
It is quite unfortunate for the Delta State Commissioner of Police to say that they rescued us. That claim by the police is a sad commentary on the pathetic situation of the country. The police should begin to talk about the problems they encounter in the discharge of their duty. There is no way they can go into that forest. I even prayed that they should not come because the kidnappers said they would kill us if the police came for rescue operation. I am not even sure that they can go into that bush. I wrote a statement in the police station and there was no where I mentioned that I was rescued. The police couldn’t even send us for checkup in a nearby hospital.
Do you have any plan to leave the country after this experience?
Every day I wake up, what comes to my mind is: what is the future of my children in this country? The country is in turmoil and the situation is getting worse daily. Even in the political sphere, old people are still being recycled. With what has happened, I may seek asylum. I cannot continue to endanger my life as I toil for my daily bread.

24th April 2022,"Gunmen kidnapped our members, cows, demanded N4m, gun as ransom –Miyetti Allah","The South-East Chairman of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Gidado Siddiki, has alleged that 10 members of the association and an undisclosed number of cows were kidnapped by gunmen.
Siddiki stated this on Saturday while addressing journalists in Awka, Anambra State
He said the incident took place at the Fulani settlement in Obene community at the Ogbaru Local Government Area of Anambra State, on Saturday, at about 1.30am.
According to him, the gunmen invaded the area with sophisticated weapons such as guns, cutlasses, sticks and charms.
 
He explained the kidnappers have established contact with the victims’ families, and had demanded N4m and a gun each as ransom.
He said, “As I speak to you now, I have reported the incident to the Police and the DSS for prompt action. I appeal to the kidnappers to release our members and their cows; those kidnapped are mere strugglers.”
Siddiki condemned the politicisation of the conflict of herdsmen and host communities conflict across the country, noting that the herdsmen were always accused of crime, even in situations where they were the victims of attack.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
He cited instances where criminals disguised in Fulani attires and committed crimes in Benue, Enugu, Ebonyi, southern Kaduna and Anambra to give the herdsmen a bad name.
He blamed the face-off between herdsmen, farmers and host communities on lack of accurate communication by concerned authorities.

“Most of the conflicts can be averted if dialogue and proper conflict management skills are established in the six geopolitical zones of the country,” he added.
Siddik, however, commended the Anambra State Governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, for initiating peace and reconciliation committee to address the security challenges in the state and the South East region at large, with a view to achieving realistic solutions.
He reiterated that the association under his watch in the South East, South South regions will continue to preach unity and peace among Nigerians irrespective of tribe, ethnicity and religious placement.
The state Police Public Relations Officer DSP Ikenga Tochukwu, confirmed the incident and urged the leadership of Miyetti Allah to come up with more information that could enable the Police to commence aggressive investigation into the matter.
Ikenga said, “Yes, we are aware of the incident, but we want the leadership of the association to supply us with more information, since the kidnappers have established contact with the victims’ families.”

2nd April 2022,"Gunmen kidnap Abia varsity students, demand N10m ransom","Unknown gunmen Thursday night kidnapped seven Abia State University Uturu, students close to the school.
Sources, as corroborated by the university Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Onyemachi Ogbulu, and the Abia Police Public Relations Officer, Geoffrey Ogbonna, said the incident happened between 7.30 pm and 8 pm at the Abia end of Okigwe – Uturu road, close to the university army checkpoint.
The exact point was said to be Ihube Okigwe/Uturu junction popularly called “Boundary” which harbours numerous security checkpoints and less than one kilometer from ABSU military checkpoint. 
Confirming the incident, the PPRO said “The truth is that the incident happened in Okigwe and Okigwe is in Imo State and the victims are students of Abia State University. Abia State and Imo State commands are on the matter. The students are from Abia and from what I heard, they are about seven in number”.
 
Also reacting, the ABSU Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Onyemachi Ogbulu, confirmed the incident, lamenting that the school is tired of such incidents.
“The thing is that in spite of the presence of all the security agents, the army, the police, the Mobile Police, there is more than six security checkpoints between Okigwe and ABSU, yet, every now and then, this happens and nobody has been arrested.
“This one just happened on Thursday night between 7 and 8 pm in spite of the warnings we gave to the students to stop going about in the night”, he said.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
He stated that since Friday, he has been in touch with all the security agencies in the state and the state government with the response, “we are working. I am in contact with the Commander of 143 Battalion. We are attacking them is the response and yet, ransom will be paid.
He regretted “we are not sincere in this country”, adding that there is the SIM card registration and tracking in the country, yet “ransom will be paid, someone will come there, pick up the ransom, go back and will not be caught”. This happens all over the country, not just in the east.
“There is no day we don’t here of one problem or the other. This is a country that cannot protect the lives and property of its citizens, which is the primary function of any government”, he said.

“We have communicated with the Commissioner of Police, Battalion Commander, the AIG, DSS and others. This is not our function. Constitutionally, security is in the Exclusive List. 
“This thing is not even the function of the local government or state government, it is the function of the Commander-In-Chief of this country and Armed Forces, otherwise, allow Nigerians to carry guns and allow the states governments to protect the lives and property of their citizens. 
“Let the governors be the real Chief Security Officer of their states “in words and in deed”.        
“Let there be state police and local government police. This country has failed, whether they like it or not”, he said.
Meanwhile, the university has issued a statement on that incident, describing it as “ugly and dastard and highly regrettable”.
He assured the parents/guardians of the abducted students that “all security apparatus within and outside the state through the intervention of the governor of Abia state and Visitor to the university, Okezie Ikpeazu is on course to ensure the quick release of the students from their abductors”.

Benue Links Transport Company is owned by the state government and has been a target of kidnappers in recent times.
The General Manager of the company, Mrs Ugela Monica, said there was no publicity when bandits hijacked a train recently and wondered why journalists wanted to write a news report about her company.
She said, “I am not aware of the abduction of our passengers. When it happened on a train and others in another place, you people did not make news (out of it); it is when it happens to Benue Links that you want to make news out of it.”

26th March 2022,"How policemen kidnapped me, extorted N100,000 by POS –Abuja artiste","Abuja-based artiste, Eche Abraham, aka Soundboi BME, tells GODFREY GEORGE how he was allegedly ‘kidnapped’ by some policemen, who extorted N100,000 from him before letting him go
Briefly introduce yourself, please.
My name is Eche Abraham, aka Soundboi BME. I am a musician based in Abuja.
A post you made, accusing some men of the Kogi Police Command of extortion went viral on social media during the week. How did this happen?
 
As you may know, I am an up-and-coming musician, and as a strategy to keep my name and face out there, I go to events and shows. I was invited to a show in Okene, Kogi State, and I set out on Sunday, March 13, 2022, for it. On my way from Abuja to Okene, very close to the Federal College of Education, some officers of the Special Weapons and Tactics Team overtook our car and packed right in front of us, almost causing a collision.
They asked all the passengers to get down, then singled me out and asked me to join them in their navy-blue Hilux van, which had no number plate. Initially refused but they slapped me and forced me into the vehicle. They took my phone from me and began to ask me all sorts of questions about what I do and all that. I told them I am a musician and was going for an event that I had already been paid for but they would not believe me.
They began to go through my phone. They looked through all the apps on my phone and were asking me if I was a Yahoo Boy (fraudster).   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
What did they say your offence was?
They didn’t say. They opened the Google Chrome app and some sex-related ads began to pop up, and they began to ask me who those white women there were. I was confused. I tried to explain to them but they refused to listen.
They also went through my mail and were asking me about the source of some mails in my box, but I told them they were promotional contents from Google and had nothing to do with me, but they would not believe me. I even told them to check all my social media accounts and see if I had any chat history with any foreigner. They checked and I came out clean.  They then said whether I liked it or not, I would pay them N250, 000.
What did they say the N250, 000 was for?
Honestly, I don’t know. I told them I didn’t have any money. They opened my Binance app, where I do buy and sell cryptocurrency and asked me how come I had $23 inside. They then concluded and insisted that I must be a Yahoo Boy. I explained to them that Binance is not a fraudulent app; that the firm is even a sponsor of the current Nigerian Idol talent show.
Did they take you to the police station for further questioning since they suspected that you were a fraudster?
I was even the one begging them to take me to their station so they could further question me but they said no. They didn’t even allow me to make any call so people would come to help me. It was like I was kidnapped. All they were interested in was money. After much deliberation, they then agreed that they would accept N100, 000. All I had in my bank account at that time was N38, 000. They then told me to call anyone that would send me money if I wanted to leave. I began to call. They made sure they monitored the calls so I would not talk too much or tell anyone that I had been kidnapped by police officers. They also monitored my bank alert till the money got to N119, 000.        
Did you transfer the money to them?  Related News   Faded PVCs, number plates: Growing lamentations over extortion by security agents  Police refund MAPOLY undergraduate after PUNCH report  Extortion: Seven Imo cops sacked, prosecuted   
They then carried me to an isolated area. I began to beg them to please give me their account number so I could send them the N100, 000 they had demanded. They laughed and started insulting me in Hausa language. They said I wanted to implicate them with the evidence of transfer and that God would punish me. One said for what I said they wouldn’t even take the N100, 000 anymore, but the N250, 000 they initially demanded. I just kept pleading with them.
They then took me to a bushy area near Nollywood at Nagazi, where there was an abandoned filling station and said they wanted to interview me. I told them to take me to the police station and do the interview but they refused. They then began to force me to say things I didn’t intend to say.
So, how did they collect this N100, 000 from you?
We began searching for Point on Sale machines to make withdrawals. The first place they took me to, the attendant said she didn’t have up to N100, 000. They took me to the second one who hailed the officers very well. When I got to him and asked him if he knew them, he said they were his customers. I told him that I was being held hostage by these officers and had been accused of what I had no idea of but he didn’t say anything. He went ahead and withdrew the N100, 000 and I was also charged N1, 000 as the service charge for the transaction.
Did you report this matter to anyone?
I posted it on social media and told some of my big friends. I couldn’t go back to the POS stand the next day to meet the attendant because some of my performer friends had an accident so I had to go check them up at the hospital. That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept wondering how I just lost N100, 000, just like that and how I could have just died like that if I hadn’t complied. The next day, I went to Inorere Junction, where the POS the withdrawal was made, to inform the attendant of what had happened and he told me that he already knew what was happening, which was why he kept mute when I told him that I was being kidnapped. He said the last time the men came to that POS stand, he told the victim to transfer the money to the officers but they insulted him, calling him a criminal. He said even their other office close to Kabba Police Station was not left out in their activities. He said if anything comes up, he was willing to testify. I even made a video while I was there, as evidence.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
Did you report to the police station?
I went back to the Okene Divisional Police Station to report. I also told one of my friends who called some people he knew at the Force Headquarters and they took up the matter.  The Investigative Police Officers got a number of one of the officers who happened to be the leader of the gang who extorted me and asked if he worked around Okene with his men on March 13 and his answer was in the affirmative. He mentioned my case and asked them to quickly send that money back if they knew what was good for them. The Divisional Police Officer, when he heard of it, was so angry. He promised to get to the bottom of the case and also to detain the officers involved in the matter. The DPO also threatened the errant officers to return the money. When they tried to call them back, the number was busy. Perhaps, they were trying to contribute the money.
I am a graduate. If not for the state of this country where graduates are paid 20, 000, 30,000 as monthly salaries, I would have been working.
What are your demands?
I don’t like trouble. They should just give me my money and let me go. I am not a criminal. I am a legit hustler.

An official of the Katsina State Emergency Management Agency, Shamsu Yakubu, revealed on Saturday that terrorists killed 12 persons and abducted 38 others during the last Tuesday’s attack on Guga town in the Bakori Local Government Area of the state.
He also revealed that the terrorists burnt no fewer than 35 shops, 11 houses and six vehicles.
Yakubu made the revelation shortly after officials of the National Emergency Management Agency and those of SEMA visited the town for the on-the-spot assessment of the situation.
 
The terrorists had attacked Guga, Dukawa and Gidan Kanawa. Dukawa and Gidan Kanawa are neigbouring communities in the Funtua Local Government Area of the state.

It was learnt that the terrorists later moved to Guga on Tuesday morning, killing 10 residents and abducting the village head, Alhaji Umar.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
The spokesperson for the police in the state, SP Gambo Isah, had confirmed the attack but gave no details.
However, he said the police repelled an attack on the Nassarawa-Bugaje village in the Jibia Local Government area of the state.
The invasion came barely 48 hours after terrorists struck at Magama-Jibiya in the same local government area, where a Divisional Police Officer, DSP Abdullahi Rano, was killed during crossfire between security operatives and the terrorists.
The spokesman for the police in the state, SP Gambo Isah, who confirmed the Friday attack, said the police were able to recover 350 domestic animals earlier rustled from the village by the terrorists.
Isah explained, “On Friday, February 11, 2022, around 4pm, a distress call was received that terrorists in their numbers on motorcycles were shooting with AK-47 rifles in Nassarawa-Bugaje village, Jibiya Local Government Area, and rustled large number of domestic animals.
“A police patrol team, led by O/C (officer-in-charge) Anti-kidnapping Unit, was dispatched to the scene and engaged the hoodlums in a gun duel. The operational strategy and tactics exhibited by the police team forced the hoodlums to retreat, abandon their mission and take to their heels.
“The team succeeded in recovering all the rustled animals, comprising 200 cows and 150 sheep. In the course of scanning the scene, two new brand operational motorcycles belonging to the terrorists were recovered. Furthermore, some stolen provisions were recovered. Investigation is ongoing.”        
The police had earlier on Friday paraded 13 suspects in Katsina for terrorism-related offences.
In Zamfara, eight people were said to have been burnt to death by terrorists at Kango village of Bungudu Local Government Area, while 29 others were abducted.
An indigene of the village, Ibrahim Sani told Sunday PUNCH on the phone that the incident happened on Friday evening when the assailants on motorcycles attacked the village.
Sani said, immediately they arrived at the village, they began to shoot in different directions to scare the villagers.
He said some people were able to escape to the bush while others ran into their houses and locked themselves.
He stated, “When they opened fire, the people ran helter-skelter for safety. Many people were able to escape as they ran into the bush, while others ran into their houses and locked themselves.”
Sani said the bandits went from house to house searching for food items, animals as well as people to abduct.

In Kaduna, terrorists invaded Ma Kura village in Atyap Chiefdom, Zango-Kataf Local Government Area of the state, killing two and injuring several others.
The attack, it was learnt, occurred on Friday night through to the early hours of Saturday, forcing residents to flee the area.
A source said the attackers who came in large numbers, moved from house to house and unleashed terror on the residents.
“The attackers came while people were asleep but the villagers were able to organise themselves against the invaders and that brought the number of those killed to about two,” he said.  
The source said those who suffered injuries had been rushed to an undisclosed hospital for medical attention, adding that several houses were razed during the attack.
He stated that security operatives had taken over the village to restore normalcy.
There was no official statement either from the state government or the police in the state.

Students have been abducted and later released.

Governor Abubakar Bello disclosed this to State House correspondents on Tuesday after he met with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, to brief him on the development.
The governor, who enumerated the series of attacks and their consequences on lives, blamed the low response time to the attacks on the lack of access roads to the affected communities.
He, however, expressed optimism that with the new measures being put in place, the security situation in the state would improve soon, adding that contiguous states must work together to stop terrorists from moving from one region to another.

PUNCH Metro gathered that the victims attended a wedding in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Saturday, and were returning to their base in Lagos State on Sunday, when one of the vehicles conveying them to their destinations broke down on the road.
One of the victims, Folahan Akinsola, who spoke to our correspondent on Monday, said they were attempting to tow the faulty vehicle when the kidnappers struck.
He said, “We went to attend a wedding in Ibadan on Saturday and lodged there after the wedding. The following day, as early as 5.30am, we started our journey to Lagos State. We moved in a convoy of three vehicles, including two Toyota Corollas and one Toyota Camry.
 
“I was in the Toyota Camry ahead of the two other vehicles and we were trying to overtake a truck on the expressway. But as our driver overtook the truck, we zoomed off and had moved quite a distance before realising that we could not see others coming behind us.
“So, we turned back and drove against traffic to search for them. We later found them by the roadside around the Isara area. One of the drivers of the Toyota Corolla, Shola, said his car developed a fault. We were cutting the seatbelt of his car to use as rope to tow the vehicle to somewhere safe when four armed men came out of the bush and kidnapped seven of us.”
Out of the seven abducted victims, Akinsola said three persons were released, as the hoodlums demanded N60m ransom for the others.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
He added, “The kidnappers were all dressed in Army uniform and commanded us to enter the bush. They were more than four, as there were some of them inside the bush. They took some personal belongings and set some of us free.
“I was part of the people that were released and we were told to go and raise N15m to secure the release of each of the remaining four victims. So, we are to raise N60m and that is why we are seeking help from Nigerians as these kidnappers said they will waste them if they don’t get the money.
“After we regained our freedom, we called 911. We were driving back to Ibadan when we met some metropolitan policemen and also reported the case to them. But we were told that the case was not within their jurisdiction. We were referred to the Isara Police Division.
“We later reported the case there and got to know that the Divisional Police Officer had mobilised about 25 policemen to the scene of the incident. These kidnappers have been sending threat videos showing us our friends in their custody.”  Related News   Gunmen kidnap nine in Abuja estate  Zamfara police rescue 14 kidnap victims held 68 days  Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi

He said, “The anti-kidnapping unit has been there since yesterday (Sunday) and the Commissioner of Police was there today (Monday) to have an on-the-spot assessment of the whole situation and to give the necessary directive.
“So, we are on it and very soon, we are having the hope of rescuing the victims alive. The purpose of the kidnap is to siphon money from their family members; it is their regular trademark.
“It was an opportunistic crime because our men are always on that road, but unfortunately, the vehicle conveying those people broke down along the road and the hoodlums took advantage of the situation to strike.”

17th January 2022,Gunmen kidnap another Plateau monarch,"Another traditional ruler in Plateau state, Da Gyang Balak, has been kidnapped by gunmen.
It was gathered that the kidnap victim, who is the Paramount ruler in Vwang District, Jos South Local Government Area, was abducted around 8 pm on Sunday.
It was learnt that the monarch was driving home along the road near the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies in Kuru community when the gunmen accosted him and whisked him away to an unknown destination.
The Vwang incident is coming less than one month after gunmen had abducted a traditional ruler in Mangu LGA, Charles Dakat, who is the Paramount Ruler of Gindiri. He was later released after a ransom was allegedly paid to the abductors.
 
The lawmaker representing Jos South in the Plateau State House of Assembly, Fom Gwattson, confirmed the latest abduction to The PUNCH in Jos on Monday.
Gwattson said “I have just been informed of the kidnap of one of our traditional rulers, Da Gwom Rwei of Vwang District, Jos South LGA, Da Gyang Balak. From what I was told, he was on his to his palace when some people blocked his vehicle and forcefully took him away around 8 pm last night”.

The lawmaker who condemned the abduction of the traditional ruler noted that his kidnap was the second of such incidents in the community in recent times.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
He said,” We have a problem at hand in Plateau state regarding kidnapping and abduction of the citizens. The area where they kidnapped the traditional ruler in Vwang District is the same place where another resident was kidnapped about two weeks ago and a ransom of N1m was paid to the kidnappers before they released the young man.
“As lawmakers elected by the people to represent them at the 9th Plateau Assembly, we have done what we are supposed to do to address the problem by passing the anti-kidnapping bill into law which was subsequently signed by Governor Simon Lalong. But who has been tried in plateau state using that law?.
“It’s just there lying in waste while the people continue to cry over their plight in the hands of abductors. I believe that the government which has the duty to arrest and prosecute those responsible for kidnapping but fails to do it knows what it is doing.
“In Katsina state, over 200 people were killed and nobody said anything. The truth is that the people of Plateau state and indeed Nigerians have entered ‘one chance’ government and unless this Government is booted out of power, the people may continue to suffer the same fate.”
The Military Information Officer of Operation Safe Haven, Major Ishaku Takwa, who also confirmed the kidnap of the traditional ruler said, “Troops of Operation SAFE HAVEN in conjunction with other security agencies are on trail of the kidnappers. God’s willing, the security agencies will soon close-up on the criminals”."

13th January 2022,"ISWAP invades Borno police college, four Nasarawa varsity students kidnapped","Scores of Islamic State West Africa Province fighters on Thursday abducted nine police instructors after laying siege to the Police Mobile Force Training College, Limankara, Gwoza, Borno State.
It was gathered that the insurgents launched a vociferous attack on the college with many Rocket-Propelled Guns for almost two hours before they overwhelmed the beleaguered policemen inside the school.
The Borno State Commissioner of Police, Mr Abdu Umar, confirmed the attack to journalists in Maiduguri on Friday but denied the abduction of the police officers.
However, reliable police sources explained that nine out of the 21 instructors in the school were kidnapped by the insurgents after the policemen ran out of ammunition.
 
Our correspondent gathered that the military failed to send reinforcements despite the fact that an army checkpoint was located not far from the school.
Shedding light on the attack, a senior police officer said the attackers came from three angles, adding that they would not have overran the school had there been reinforcement.
The source stated that the policemen ran out of ammunition and later resorted to smoke gas which prevented the terrorists from entering the college for some time.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
He said, “From Gwoza town to Limankara is just 15km and there is an army formation there. The policemen said they called for reinforcement but there was no response. Nine instructors were kidnapped out of the 21 instructors in the camp.
“The place wasn’t fortified; the authorities only repaired the fence that was damaged by the terrorists during previous attacks. They were about restarting training there before this latest attack.”
Another source said the school was not properly fortified, noting that the policemen could have successfully repelled the attack if they had a functional armoured tank.
He also lamented the failure of the military to send reinforcement, noting that help could have come for the policemen within five minutes.
The officer added, “If there was coordination among the forces, reinforcements can get to the training school within five minutes because there is an army checkpoint around that place.
“You know it is between Madagali and Gwoza; that place is the border between Adamawa and Borno but it is under Borno. So, there is a checkpoint close to the place. If the school has a standard armoured tank, there is no way the insurgents can breach the camp.’’
The senior officer recalled the short time reinforcements took during a peacekeeping operation in Mali.        
He noted, “When we were in Mali on a peacekeeping operation, when we called for reinforcement whenever we were under attack; from Bamako to our location is one hour, 45 minutes but within a few minutes, the reinforcement will be there. But in Nigeria, it is the next morning reinforcement would come.
“The instructors ran out of ammunition and the insurgents were using RPGs and the policemen did not have any RPG. It was the smoke gas that helped the instructors to resist the attacks for some time. Rivalry (between the security forces) is the issue. Nobody came to the rescue of the men from 8pm when the attack started till around 10pm.’’
The State Police Command confirmed the attack at the Mobile Police training school in Limankara, Gwoza LGA around 8:22 Thursday night but said none of her personnel was abducted by the Boko Haram insurgents.
The state Commissioner of Police, Abdu Umar, confirmed the incident while addressing the press at the command’s headquarters in Maiduguri.

4th January 2022,"IPOB denies killing, kidnapping monarchs in South-East","The Indigenous People of Biafra has denied the reports that the Eastern Security Network has any involvement in the recent killings and kidnappings in the South East region.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, also denied a report that the ESN operatives were the ones who allegedly besieged the palace of Eze Emmanuel Eze Okeke of Amaifeke in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State.
Powerful said, “It is true that we criticise some traitors among our people, including politicians, traditional rulers, president generals, and even fake religious leaders. Our condemnation of their unpatriotic actions against BIAFRA has not got to the level of going after any of them.
“Maybe, very soon this group of people behind the bloodletting in our land will start going after religious leaders and blame their abominable act on IPOB and ESN.”
 
He added that the group, as led by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, fights for freedom and is only interested in the emancipation of its people from slavery.
Powerful continued, “For the umpteenth time, IPOB and ESN have no hands in the spate of killings and abductions in any part of BIAFRA land. Such barbarity is not part of our mandate.  Related News   IPOB disowns those calling for no election in South-East  No plan to attack banks in South-East – IPOB  IPOB not interested in elections, wants referendum – Spokesman

Some wicked people in power, in collaboration with the security agencies, are the masterminds of the insecurity in our land.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
“There is a report that the security agents repelled ESN operatives who allegedly besieged the palace of Eze Emmanuel Eze Okeke of Amaifeke in Orlu LGA Imo State. This is another blatant lie from the pit of hell. IPOB/ESN operatives have no issues with traditional rulers in Biafraland but Nigeria Army and the police are trying to create the wrong impression that we are hunting the monarchs.”
He disclosed that some state governors have started using the Ebubeagu security outfit to kill and burn down properties belonging to their political opponents and they must be made to account for these atrocities.
The statement also added, “Any state in Biafra territory operating with Ebubeagu security must consider themselves an enemy of the people because Ebubeagu is now raping our women and claiming it is soldiers from the North. How could the so-called Ebubeagu security outfit decide to be raping our mothers and sisters and think they are our people?
“If they are truly Igbo people, they won’t tamper with our ladies for any reason, but they will focus on pursuing Fulani terrorists herdsmen terrorising our people in the bushes and forests. But because these bunch of criminals know that they are not Igbo people, they will do whatever they like to humiliate our women in the name of security.
“Many buildings have been burnt down in Umutanze, Amaifeke in Orlu, and Orsu by Ebubeagu in conjunction with Nigeria compromised security agents in Imo State. This madness must stop.”"
3rd January 2022,"Food crisis to worsen as bandits kill, kidnap 352 farmers in 12 months","The lingering food crisis in some parts of Nigeria may worsen and spread to more states in 2022 as the country loses more farmers to the gruesome activities of bandits and insurgents, SAMI OLATUNJI reports
At least 352 farmers have been killed and kidnapped in 12 months amid the rising insecurity in Nigeria, a tally by The PUNCH has shown. The 352 comprised 216 killed farmers and 136 kidnapped farmers.
The figures were obtained from the Nigeria Security Tracker, a project of the Council on Foreign Relations’ Africa, as well as media reports.
The Council on Foreign Relations is a United States non-profit think tank specialising in US foreign policy and international affairs. It is headquartered in New York City, with an additional office in Massachusetts
 
The figure exceeds 352 as there were cases of killings and kidnappings of farmers with unknown numbers.
Farmers have been under serial attacks across the country, fuelling fear of acute food shortage if the government does not intervene proactively, The PUNCH has learnt.
Across the six geo-political zones, findings revealed that farmers were abandoning their farmsteads, plantations, orchards, and processing factories amid the spate of armed invasion, kidnapping, and attacks.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
According to findings by our correspondent, the most affected states are Plateau, Nasarawa, Oyo, Niger, Zamfara, Borno, and Ondo.
In January, 13 farmers were killed, with seven executed by bandits in Niger State while many were injured. Three farmers were killed in Oyo State, one in Osun State and two others in Kaduna State. There was a sad case of kidnappers killing an Ibadan farmer despite collecting N1.65m ransom from the family. On January 30, it was reported that farmers fled as herdsmen allegedly attack Igangan in Oyo State.
In February, a total of 20 killings and kidnappings were recorded, with 12 feared killed in Bassa, Plateau State during a farmers-herders clash.
In Edo State, it was reported that herdsmen killed three farmers, setting farmlands worth N600m ablaze. It was also reported that Fulani herdsmen killed three farmers in Ondo State.
In March, a total of 15 cases of killing and kidnapping were reported. According to media reports, gunmen on motorcycles killed four farmers in an Oyo community, while three others were abducted in another community in Ibadan, Oyo State. In Plateau, three were reportedly killed while farm crops were destroyed in Bassa.
In April, 14 farmers were killed, with nine farmers shot dead in Nasarawa State while gunmen killed three other farmers in Taraba State. Twice, Fulani herdsmen were reported to have hacked down farmers in the Ibarapa North Local Government Area of Oyo State.
In May, it was reported that bandits killed eight farmers in a Zamfara State community.        
In June, a total of 33 killings and kidnappings were reported, with 12 farmers killed as bandits attacked Zamfara communities. In Benue State, suspected herders ambushed farmers and killed 11 persons in two different communities. In Niger, communal clash over farmland claimed three lives, with several houses burnt.
In July, a total of 10 killings and kidnappings were recorded, with gunmen abducting four farmers in Ekiti State and demanding N50m, while suspected herders killed five Tiv farmers in Nasarawa State.
In August, a total of 16 killings and kidnappings occurred, with bandits killing eight farmers in Kaduna, while unknown gunmen killed five farmers in Ile-Ife, Osun State.

In September, a total of 57 killings and kidnappings occurred, which included the alleged killing of 50 fishermen by Nigeria airstrike in Borno State as reported on September 26. The total number of kidnappings is likely higher as it was reported on September 6 that Fulani herdsmen abducted an unknown number of farmers In Kwara State.
There seemed to be no reported case of killings or kidnappings of farmers in October. However, in November, a total of 78 killings and kidnappings occurred. It was reported that the Islamic State West Africa Province fighters held 76 farmers, hostage, for two days in Borno State. The insurgents had reportedly warned the farmers in the area against burning shrubs and thickets for harvest as it often give the ISWAP fighters cover from Nigerian troops. Also, in Bassa, Plateau, it was reported that Fulani herdsmen killed two farmers.
In December, the highest number of cases was recorded as a total of 88 killings and kidnappings were reported. About 36 farmers were kidnapped by bandits at Jangali Bagoma, a border town between the Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State and Niger State. It was also reported that at least 45 people were killed in renewed hostilities in Lafia, in the Obi and Awe local government areas of Nasarawa State.
Food security is one of the 14 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. The United Nations Development Programme stated that to achieve food security by 2030, each country must “double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land.”   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
However, due to the rising cases of insecurity across the country, there seems to be a looming food crisis, which may begin to manifest in 2022, according to analysts.
The Federal Government in its National Development Plan 2021 – 2025 admitted that food insecurity is a major concern, noting that food security, which is essential for development, declined in the country.
The plan document read in part, “Food insecurity is also a major concern to the government and the various stakeholders. Food security is a prerequisite for development…
“Nigeria’s food security index declined from 46.5 in 2017 to 40.1 in 2020, while the hunger index averaged 29.4. This can be connected with security-induced supply constraints issues, causing food prices to rise. Food inflation rose from an average of 14.4 per cent in 2018 to 16.11 per cent in 2020.”
The government admitted that there was a gap in service provision in terms of food and nutrition, adding a rising security issue was threatening food supply and increasing uncertainty around food prices.
“Although the National Plan of Action for Food and Nutrition was instituted in 2004, Nigeria has not been able to bridge the gaps in the service provisioning, quality, and outcomes as envisioned in the plan.
“Some of the key challenges experienced in this sector include rising security issues threatening food supply and the uncertainty around food prices,” it read in part.  
The Federal Government, however, plans to address food insecurity issues in the country and achieve nutrition security in vulnerable communities.
The government aims that the country’s food security index will be 60.1 by 2025, from 40.1 as of 2020. It also plans to reduce the prevalence of severe food insecurity from 19.6 per cent in 2020 to 10 per cent by 2025.
It is expected that the rising cases of killing and kidnapping of farmers may affect this goals if the government fails to address the problems.

2nd January 2022,"Gunmen kidnap wife, child of Enugu commissioner's younger brother","Gunmen have reportedly kidnapped the wife and a child of Mr Eugene Edeoga, younger brother of the Enugu State Commissioner for Environment, Hon Chijioke Edeoga on Saturday night.
They were said to have been kidnapped inside their house at the old Eke Market in Eha-Amufu, Isi-Uzo Local Government Area of the state.
This is coming barely a week five persons were abducted at a notorious pipeline near Federal College of Education along Eha-Amufu – Agu-Amede – Ikem – Ubolo-Afor Road.
Most of the abductions were attributed by some stakeholders to the deplorable state of the section of the road that was said to be less than six kilometres.
 
A community leader, Chief Godswill Ndukwe, who confirmed the recent abduction to our correspondent, on Sunday, however, noted that security operatives led by the Nigeria Police Force had already begun searching for them to ensure their immediate rescue.
Ndukwe, who said he received the report of their abduction around 8pm, lamented that “Eha-Amufu is currently in turmoil since the information of the abduction filtered into the air on Saturday evening. The disturbing part of this abduction is that they were abducted inside their house.
“This was the second scenario where kidnappers would be entering their victims’ house to abduct them. The first was the kidnap of the eight-year-old daughter of the chairman of Agu-Amede community, Mr Sunday, a.k.a Sharia, in November last year.

“Unfortunately, since this festive period, no fewer than 10 persons had been abducted before this incident. They (kidnappers) started with the kidnap of a Catholic priest in Ebo Community. A few days later, three people in tricycle were abducted and last week five others were abducted along Eha-Amufu -Ikem Road.”
Another community leader, Sunday Sharia, also told our correspondent that immediately after The PUNCH reported the kidnap incident of last week, a team of policemen from the State Police Command stormed Eha-Amufu and arrested scores of youths, accusing them of being behind the kidnapping incidences.
“However, most of them were still in detention at the police headquarters when this recent kidnapping occurred. So, who is now behind the kidnapping?” he queried.
He added, “Most of our people that were kidnapped and released after ransom was paid had told people that those that kidnapped them were Fulani herdsmen. I wondered why police instead of looking for the abductors resorted to arresting our youths for the crime.”
Meanwhile, our correspondent gathered that people were no longer moving freely in Eha-Amufu as a result of the recent development.
The State Police Public Relations Officer, Daniel Ndukwe, when contacted, did not answer the calls put through to his phone.
Also, as of the time of filing this report, he had yet to respond to a text message sent to him."
2nd January 2022,Gunmen kidnap ex-Plateau gov aspirant,"A former governorship aspirant in the 2019 election in Plateau State, Nkemi Nicholas Nshe, has been kidnapped by gunmen.
The PUNCH gathered that Nshe, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party who had served as the chairman of Shendam Local Government Area of the state at different periods in the past, was kidnapped alongside Dr Monday Hassan who is the Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities at the Plateau state University, Bokkos.
It was further gathered that the two persons said to be friends were abducted at the residence of the former Council boss in Shendam in the early hours of Saturday.
Governor Simon Lalong hails from Shendam LGA in the Southern Zone.
 
Nshe’s abduction came barely 24 hours after kidnappers released a traditional ruler in the neighbouring central zone of the state, Charles Mato Dakat.
Before his release, the traditional ruler was abducted by gunmen at his palace in Gindiri community, Mangu LGA last Sunday around 1am.
He spent five days in the hands of the kidnappers who had demanded N500 million ransom.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
Although troops of the Military Taskforce in charge of maintaining peace in the state, otherwise known as Operation Safe Haven, said they arrested eight persons in connection with the kidnap of the monarch, they were unable to disclose if any ransom was eventually paid to secure his freedom
However, sources in Shendam LGA confirmed the latest abduction to The PUNCH in Jos on Sunday  Related News   Anger as gunmen kill 35 in Katsina, Kaduna  Gunmen attack Abuja estate, kidnap nine  Gunmen kill village head in Kano    
An associate of Nshe in Shendam, who lamented the abduction of the former council boss, told our Correspondent that the incident was causing tension in the Council area.
He said, “Please join us in praying for the release of Dr Nkemi Nshe who was forcefully kidnapped from his Shendam residence in the early hours of Saturday being the New Year day, January 1, 2022. It was in the night that the gunmen came to his house and whisked him away. They did not go with his phone.
“The incident is rather unfortunate. We don’t know where they have taken him to. But yesterday evening (Saturday), I learnt that the kidnappers called the family members through the phone number of the son and demanded N100 million ransom which they later reduced to N50 million.
“Where will they get that kind of money when people are just suffering everywhere? It baffles me why the Federal Government through the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy would make Nigerians go through hard experiences by subjecting them to SIM card registration and yet, this kind of thing would be happening without the perpetrators being apprehended. What is the relevance of that registration exercise? Where are we going in this country in this kind of situation? We pray that the former council chairman be released safely because he has done nothing to warrant his abduction.”
Another source from the ASUU Secretariat at the Plateau State University, who also confirmed the kidnap of the ASUU boss, added, “The ASUU chairman, Dr Monday Hassan is a friend to the former Council chairman. They were together in his( Nkemi Nshe) house in Shendam when the gummen attacked them and took them away. The security situation in this country is really pathetic and unacceptable as no one is safe anymore. But for how long shall we continue in this manner without the government waking up to its responsibility and save the citizens?”        
The Spokesman for the Plateau State Police Command, Ubah Ogaba, when contacted said he would get back to our Correspondent after getting details on the incident.
The Spokesman for the Plateau state Police Command, Ubah Ogaba, when contacted said the command had deployed security operatives to rescue the kidnapped victims.
Ogaba said, “The Command is aware of the abduction in Shendam. Tactical teams have since been deployed to rescue the victims and arrest the perpetrators.”"

“They are advised to be security-conscious in order not to fall victim to these attacks and destructive political maneuvers.”
However, checks by Sunday PUNCH revealed that on December 15, gunmen abducted and killed an Imo monarch, Paul Ogbu, and one other in Okigwe.

Meanwhile, the DSS similarly experienced an attack on its base in the Abaji Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory as suspected kidnappers killed one vigilante and abducted one DSS officer.
The coordinator, Northern Alliance Movement, Yahuza Getso, said the development showed that no one was safe in the country.
“And Lai Mohammed (Minister of Information and Culture)  said the Buhari regime has recorded significant progress in the area of security. This administration has exhibited it lacks the competence to tackle insecurity. The truth of the matter is that no one is safe; the president is an absolute failure. We will not forget this administration for bad. This is a very unorganised and confused government,’’ he said.
The Director-General, International Institute of Professional Security, Tony Ofoyetan, said the inability to rein in the criminal elements have emboldened them to carry out dastardly attacks.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

29th December 2021,"Fear grips Enugu community, herdsmen kidnap seven holidaying residents","There is uneasy calm in Eha-Amufu, in the Isi-Uzo Local Government Area of Enugu State after suspected herdsmen allegedly kidnapped in one week seven residents who returned for Christmas and New Year celebrations.
PUNCH Metro gathered that about five persons were abducted on Monday along the Eha-Amufu-Agu-Amede-Ikem road.
A community leader, Mr Divine Nwonye, who hails from Agu-Amede community in Eha-Amufu, told our correspondent that his younger brother, who came home to celebrate Christmas, was among those kidnapped.
He said there was no week without a report of people being kidnapped by bandits suspected to be herdsmen along the Eha-Amufu-Ikem road.
 
“There is no road or security in Isi-Uzo LGA and it is made worse because of bad road. I am begging the governor to look into our plight and save us from the incessant kidnapping along the Eha-Amufu-Agu-Amede-Ikem federal road. Within this year alone, we have recorded no fewer than 10 abductions with 23 people involved.
“Our people have paid several millions of naira in ransom to herdsmen, while about three people were killed along the road by the same bandits,” he added.
Nwonye stated that in the last one week, they recorded seven kidnap cases on the road.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     
“The same bandits after releasing a Catholic priest in one of the parishes in Eha-Amufu, yesterday (Monday) kidnapped about five people just after the Federal College of Education.
“As it is now, the abductors have not contacted us. The last time they kidnapped the eight-year-old daughter of the chairman of Agu-Amede community, the Commissioner of Police, Abubakar Lawal, told us to go and pay ransom to the kidnappers. That has worsened our situation as police hardly come when contacted for any case of kidnapping,” he stated.  Related News   50 feared killed as suspected herdsmen invade Benue communities  Ondo communities lament herdsmen invasion  Tension as suspected herdsmen kill farmers in Delta   
While lamenting the incessant kidnapping along the Eha-Amufu-Ikem road, Nwonye said he had abandoned his rice farm for fear of being abducted.
Another community leader, Raymond Ugwu, said it was unfortunate that the state government could not stop the abductions by fixing the road, which was less than five kilometres.
He said, “The kidnapping along the Eha-Amufu-Ikem road is largely because of bad road. Every time, our people are running on that road and we don’t have any option than that. On Monday, they kidnapped our people, but I don’t know exactly the number; but they are more than two.
“The report I got was that the kidnappers started their operation from 5pm and that was the time our people were returning to their villages and communities. Kidnappers are making the road miserable for us. Our people are no longer going to the market. They are no longer moving around safely; everybody is running helter-skelter.”
Efforts to get the reaction of the state police command were unsuccessful as the police spokesman, Daniel Ndukwe, could not be reached on his telephone line.        
He also did not respond to a text message sent to him on the abductions.

Agu-Amede community is in the Isi-Uzo Local Government Area of Enugu State and has a boundary with Benue State. The community had witnessed several herdsmen attacks including a series of abductions for ransom which were barely reported.
It was gathered that the recent incident occurred on Sunday morning when the herdsmen numbering about seven stormed Olinya’s house with AK-47 rifles to attack him but he escaped. They kidnapped his daughter, Nmesoma, after allegedly ransacking the house and stole some valuables.
Sources told our correspondent that the attack seemed connected with the insistence of Agu-Amede community, which Olinya was also their chairman, insisted that herdsmen should not come to destroy farm crops in their community three weeks ago after over 50 hectares of rice farms that were almost ready for harvest were destroyed by cows.
 
Orinya, who confirmed the attack and the abduction of his daughter on Monday in a telephone interview with our correspondent, said that he had reported the incident to the police and some officers had visited his house twice.
Narrating the incident, he said “I was sleeping around 1 am on Sunday morning and I heard a bang on the door. I was sleeping in the living room so immediately I woke up. I heard the second bang I stood up and asked who is that? But I got no response.
“I went close to one of the windows and looked outside, I saw two herdsmen with AK-47 rifles positioned to shoot. I rushed to the back door, I equally saw two herdsmen positioned with their AK-47. All the lights in the house were off but the security lights were on and my wife and children were still sleeping in their rooms.      
“And they (herders) had positioned themselves around my house. So, the only option available since there was no network to call for assistance was to find a way to escape. Luckily for me, there is one window in the house that had no burglary proof and I had to escape from there.”
He added, “immediately, they noticed that I had escaped they started shooting indiscriminately in my position but I was unhurt. However, in other not to attract much attention, they rushed, broke one of the windows and went inside the house. They ransacked everywhere, collected some valuables including money and my wife’s phone and kidnapped my eight-year-old daughter who was sleeping.

“My wife told me that they looked for her as she overheard them asking my daughter where is her mother. According to her, when they heard the shooting she and my son woke up and went and hide inside one of the rooms but my daughter was still sleeping in her room.”
Olinya, however, noted that his family have established contact with them through the wife’s phone and that they are demanding N15 million ransom for her release.
He said, “They told a family member who was in constant contact with them that they came to killing me and not to abduct my daughter, that I had unfinished business with them.”
Asked what kind of unfinished business does he has with them, Olinya said “I don’t know. What I know is that my community asked them about a month ago not to come to destroy our farm crops. This happened after they destroyed with their cows about 50 hectares of rice farms in Akpouf Agu-Amede.
“So, during the incident, one of the owners of the cows said that his boy was wounded and insisted that he must be treated. Our community sent N50,000 to the Alhaji for the treatment of the boy herder he claimed was injured. Our people didn’t kill their cattle or their people. The same Alhaji had come to my house with other leaders on two occasions with huge money to allow them to graze their cattle in my community which were turned down.”        
The State Police Public Relations Officer, Daniel Ndukwe, has confirmed the attack and abduction of the little girl but denied that the attackers were herdsmen.
Ndukwe said, “What we had is a case of alleged abduction of one 8-year-old Nmesoma Olinya (f), on 21/11/2021 at about 3.48 am, by yet-to-be-identified armed hoodlums suspected to be armed robbers, who broke into their residence at Agu-Amede in Isi-Uzo LGA on the said date and abducted her, while her parents escaped.

The bandits were said to have stormed the town on Monday, shooting continuously before kidnapping the victims.

“So, when he called yesterday (Monday), he told us that some people would come and meet us at Ala town so that we would proceed to where the cows were kept. On getting to Ala, they took us to where the cows were and asked us to park our vehicles so that they could move the cows to the main road.
“As they entered into the bush, four of us waited beside the vehicles. Surprisingly, they returned with guns and started shooting into the air. They kidnapped my boss. The three of us left tried to run for our lives; as I was trying to move, they cut me with a machete. I fell and pretended as if I was dead.
“When I realised that they had left, I stood up and ran around the bush. It was only my boss I saw that they kidnapped, but the other two of us, we still don’t know their whereabouts till now. Maybe they later kidnapped them too, we are not certain.”
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs Funmilayo Odunlami, who confirmed the incident and the death of the two butchers, said men of the command were already in the forest to rescue the remaining victim.        
She said, “Initially, we thought it was a case of robbery, but when we got to the scene, we saw that it was a case of kidnapping and murder. A team of policemen is in the area to get clues on the whereabouts of the fourth person and the kidnappers and to ensure the last victim is rescued alive. We will apprehend the perpetrators.”

13th November 2021,"Masked thugs storm Ogun community, rape housewives, kidnap two","•My baby cried as three men raped me – Nursing mother
About 50 masked persons, armed with different weapons including guns, cutlasses, and axes have reportedly attacked residents and business owners in Agbaakin community, close to Mowe, in the Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State.
City Round gathered that during the two-day raid, the hoodlums destroyed property in the community, attacked passersby and broke into homes and shops to dispossess the occupants of their valuables.
According to the aggrieved members of the community, the armed men also took advantage of the tension created during the attacks to rape housewives and whisked away two residents to an undisclosed location.
 
A landlord in the community, Ibrahim Meshioye, said the kidnapped victims had yet to be reunited with their families, adding that residents deserted their homes due to the insecurity occasioned by the incessant attacks on the community.
Meshioye said, “Around 2pm last Friday, about 30 hoodlums, who wore black masks and armed with weapons such as guns, cutlasses, axes and daggers, stormed Agbaakin community to attack residents and business owners. They came in commercial vehicles, mini buses, private cars and shot into the air.
“Everyone scampered to safety but some were unlucky. They robbed residents, business owners and passersby of about 15 phones, cash and other valuables. They operated for over one hour, stole and destroyed a lot of property belonging to people in the community. When they were leaving, they kidnapped two residents, Akorede and Monday.      
“We have yet to see the kidnapped victims but we reported the invasion at the Mowe Police Station. Surprisingly around 3pm on Monday, this set of armed hoodlums, more than 50 of them, attacked the community again.”
Meshioye said during the second attack, the assailants used cutlasses and axes to inflict injuries on farmers and stole their goods, adding that they allegedly raped two housewives.
The 43-year-old said, “The second attack was more intense; and the people involved were more than those attacked last Friday. A lot of men were not around as they had gone to work. Some men also abandoned their homes as it appeared that the hoodlums were aiming at kidnapping them
“They broke into homes, robbed residents and raped housewives whose husbands were not at home. After raping one of the victims, they stole her phone and money. After the attack, we saw them crying and had to rush them to a nurse for treatment.
“The matter was reported to the Area Commander in the Obafemi Owode LGA. People have deserted their homes because of the situation; I have abandoned my house; my family is scattered everywhere despite having a house in the community. We want the government and police to come to our rescue.”  Related News   Teenager, guardian in court for kidnapping children  NigeriaElections2023: Thugs destroy ballot box in Ogun gov’s hometown  Thugs attack ADP supporters in Lagos, five injured   
One of the victims, a nursing mother of two, told our correspondent that three hoodlums raped her in her shop while her baby cried.
She said, “I was in my shop when about 10 of the people that attacked us entered. They robbed me of my Infinix phone, N25,000, and the N50,000 my husband kept with me. After that, they started making advances to forcefully have sex with me but I resisted them. They were armed with guns, cutlasses and axes and said they would kill me if I didn’t cooperate with them. They spoke in Yoruba and English but I can’t identify them as they wore masks. I struggled with them but they overpowered me. They removed my pants and raped me. I was raped by three men. My baby was crying but they continued.”        
The nursing mother’s husband, while shedding tears, demanded the arrest and prosecution of the suspects who perpetrated the crime.
However, overwhelmed by the insecurity in the community, the residents reported to a human rights organisation, Balanced Measures Impact Initiative.
A video clip in possession of our correspondent showed one of the bullets reportedly fired by the hoodlums. Pictures of some of the injured victims were also sighted.
The state Chairman, BMII, Taiwo Yemi, urged the state Governor, Dapo Abiodun, and the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, to intervene and restore normalcy to the community.
 He said, “There are laws to govern how people behave in society. The residents said the attacks were instigated by someone but how can someone just bring people to attack residents in the community? He used the people he brought to chase everyone out of the community.
“He said the community belongs to him; what the concerned residents want is that the Governor, Dapo Abiodun, and the Commissioner of Police should intervene. They want security so they can return home.”
The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, had yet to respond to calls and a text message sent to his mobile phone as of the time this report was filed.

9th November 2021,"Kidnappers abduct three, demand N10m ransom, drugs  in Ogun","Some gunmen suspected to be kidnappers abducted three residents of Ogun State on Saturday and demanded a sum of N10m and hard drugs as ransom.
The kidnappers also reportedly shot one person while struggling to kidnap him but later escaped from them.
The gunmen reportedly hid in a bush in Obada-Oko in the Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State and unleashed their terror on the people in the community.
They allegedly went away with three residents after the police from the Obada-Oko division engaged them in a gun duel.
 
Narrating his ordeal, the survivor, Razaq Lasisi, said he narrowly escaped from the kidnappers.
Lasisi, who spoke with our correspondent on the telephone, said the incident happened on Saturday.
Lasisi, who said he was a former secondary school principal, narrated that on his way returning home from his place of work around 9pm, there was an attempt to kidnap him.      
He said the spot where the kidnappers wanted to abduct him was called Ogba Kehinde, a stone’s throw to his house.
He said he saw a car with all the doors opened being parked at the entrance of Ogba Kehinde.
According to him, Ogba Kehinde is a six-acre land with some buildings on that land but for some time now, the land has been abandoned by the owner.
Lasisi said the palace was being used for a poultry farm long before Obada-Oko developed to the present state.
He claimed that the buildings on the acres of land now harboured criminals.  Related News   Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi  Gunmen kidnap Taraba monarch’s wives, son  Woman lures four-year-old to kidnappers, Rivers police arrest suspects

He said, “The kidnappers have called today and asked us to pay N10 million before they can release their victims.        
“They said we should come along with packs of codeine, marijuana, water and food as ransom.
“But, after serious appeals, they have reduced the ransom to N1.5 million with codeine, water and food “.
While narrating his ordeal, he said “As I was about to alight from the car, a man came out from a hidden place in front of my car, where there is a barbing saloon and two other people came out at the back of the car.
“The one that came out from the side of the Barbing saloon pointed a gun at me.
“Immediately I tried to escape, he shot me, but, glory be to God Almighty.
“He shot me twice, and as I was about to move faster, one grabbed me and I gave the person a heavy blow which made him to leave me.”
When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident.      
Oyeyemi said one suspect had been arrested in connection with the incident.
Oyeyemi said, “Yes, it is true. The suspected arrested is a strong member of the kidnappers.

Usman, while appearing before the House of Representatives’ Committee on Basic Education to defend the commission’s proposed 2022 budget, said the situation led to the decision to procure a 25KV transmitter to broadcast lessons from the safety of a radio studio.
He also said the commission was working with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and the National Livestock Development Plan to establish schools in grazing reserves to check the problem of kidnapping by bandits.
He said, “The honourable member asked about the running of nomadic schools now in view of this insurgency. We at the commission, we also have been pondering over this. But more importantly, we were also victims of the same type of banditry and kidnapping.
 
“My colleagues in the commission have been kidnapped several times; not only once, not twice, not three times. But then, we came around it to say ‘look, we need to do a few things over and above what is existing.’
“Those things are – if you can look at our budgets for 2021 and 2022 – since 2018, we decided to go to the Nigeria Broadcasting Commission to get a licence to have a radio that we can broadcast to our clientele and sensitise them, and do educational programmes that some of these pupils would acquire via radio.
“We now have two studios for broadcast and transmitting. That is why in 2021, we are budgeting an amount to buy a transmitter so we can start the broadcast, so we can also be a little bit safe in the comfort of the broadcasting studios and be able to talk to them in the manner they would understand.

The commission was directed to make available all the necessary details of the budget to the commission.

29th September 2021,"How UK policeman kidnapped, raped, murdered woman -Court","A serving British police officer kidnapped a woman as she walked home, falsely arresting her on the pretence of breaching coronavirus restrictions, before raping and murdering her, a court was told on Wednesday.
The disappearance of Sarah Everard during a national lockdown in March was one of Britain’s most high-profile missing person investigations and sparked protests and a debate about women’s safety on the streets.
Wayne Couzens, 48, who served with the elite diplomatic protection unit of London’s Metropolitan Police, admitted her kidnapping, rape and murder in July.
Everard, who had been visiting a friend in Clapham, south London, was strangled then set on fire. Her remains were found in woodland a week after she was snatched.
 
At a two-day sentencing hearing, prosecutor Tom Little said Couzens targeted the 33-year-old marketing executive on March 3, after finishing a shift at the US embassy.
Couzens, who was off-duty but wearing his police belt, kidnapped Everard in a “false arrest”, by “handcuffing her and showing his warrant card”, he added.
Security camera footage showed him holding up the police ID, handcuffing Everard then putting her into a car he had hired “to kidnap and rape a lone woman”, he said.      
A couple driving past in a car witnessed the scene but assumed an undercover police officer was making an arrest, the lawyer added.
But he said Couzens exploited his knowledge and experience of police patrols enforcing lockdown restrictions and knew what language to use.
Vulnerable 
From the moment Everard was handcuffed at 9:34 pm, it was just three minutes before Couzens drove off with her in the car, taking her to Dover, on the English south coast.
There, he transferred her to his own car — again captured on camera, driving her to a remote rural area where he raped her.
Couzens, a married father-of-two, told a psychiatrist he used his police belt to strangle Everard before setting her body on fire and dumping it in bags.
Police checked security camera footage and identified Couzens through his hire car. He was arrested at his home on March 9, just minutes after he deleted his phone data.
A former boyfriend of Everard said she was “savvy and streetwise” and would not have got into a car with a stranger except “by force or manipulation”, Little said.        
“The fact she had been to a friend’s house for dinner at the height of the early 2021 lockdown made her more vulnerable to and more likely to submit to an accusation that she had acted in breach of the Covid regulations in some way,” the lawyer told the court.
Little told judge Adrian Fulford the “unprecedented” case was so exceptional it could warrant a whole-life jail sentence. Sentencing is due to be passed on Thursday.
‘Look at me’ 
Couzens sat in the dock at London’s Old Bailey with his head bowed, watched by Everard’s family, who gave emotional victim impact statements to the court.
Everard’s mother Susan said her daughter “lost her life because Couzens wanted to satisfy his perverted desires. It is a ridiculous reason”.
“I am outraged that he masqueraded as a policeman in order to get what he wanted,” she added.
The victim’s father, Jeremy, asked the killer, “Mr Couzens, please will you look at me”, before telling him: “No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us.”
Before the hearing, the Metropolitan Police said they were “sickened, angered and devastated by this man’s crimes, which betray everything we stand for”.      
The force has sacked the officer and said his actions “raise many questions and concerns” but it would not comment further until after the sentencing.
Demonstrators outside the court held banners with slogans criticising the police such as “Met Police Blood On Your Hands” and let off smoke flares.
The government has pledged to improve legislation after Everard’s murder sparked widespread anger at women’s lack of safety in public spaces, as well as low conviction rates for offences including rape, domestic abuse and stalking.

16th September 2021,"Gunmen kidnap two poultry farmers, one other in Kogi","Two poultry farmers and another man have been kidnapped in Egbeda community, Kabba in Kogi West Senatorial District. The trio were abducted at two different locations within the community on Wednesday.
Our correspondent gathered that two of the abductees, Olorunpomi Damilola, a staff of the College of Education(Technical) Kabba, and Pastor Mayowa Otitolaye are partners in a poultry farm business.
However, the identity of the third abductee is still unknown. 
It was gathered that the gun-wielding men shot sporadically to scare away onlookers as they kidnapped their victims behind the Christ Apostolic Church, Egbeda-Kabba.
 
A stakeholder who wished to remain anonymous pointed out the need to engage the services of an indigenous security squad to help in securing the community but also lamented the lack of mobilization.

He said that other neighbouring communities in Okun land have already taken to this precautionary measure to forestall such insecurities of lives and property, reiterating the need to do the same in the entire Kabba land as many men of shady characters have infiltrated the surrounding forest.
One Yomi Obalore opined that the entire Ikowaopa, a suburb of Kabba seems to be under the control of non-indigenes and there is the need for everyone to be circumspect.      
The State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP William Aya who confirmed the incident said that the District Police Officer in charge of the area informed the command around 9 pm on Wednesday.
He said that officers and men have teamed up with the local vigilantes and other security agencies to hunt the kidnappers.
“Our men are combing the bush at the moment and we are optimistic they the abducted victims would be rescued while the kidnappers will be apprehended,” Aya said."
16th September 2021,"Gunmen invade farmhouse, kidnap businessman, shoot passerby","Gunmen have kidnapped a livestock farmer, Jide Lawal, at his farmhouse around Agohun community, Emoren-Imota, a boundary area between Lagos and Ogun states.
PUNCH Metro gathered that Lawal went to monitor his farm on Wednesday when the armed men waylaid him at the front gate.
The businessman was said to be waiting for his guard to open the gate when the assailants took advantage of the situation to block him.
At gunpoint, the bandits reportedly demanded he surrender himself.
 
As the guard opened the gate, the three-man gang was said to have ushered Lawal into the premises of the farmhouse.
A managing consultant at the farmhouse, Ahmed Saliu, told our correspondent that the gunmen whisked away Lawal through a nearby bush.
He said, “We were inside the farmhouse when Mr Lawal got to the gate and pressed the horn to signal the gateman to open the gate. But as the gateman opened, I saw three armed men pointing a gun at us, as they led Mr Lawal into the farmhouse.      
“They ordered all of us to lie on the ground and subsequently abducted our boss. We reported at the Imota Police Station and also informed family members of our boss.
“When the police were searching the bush, they discovered that the assailants spent the night in the bush. During the operation, the hoodlums covered their faces to conceal their identities.”
A farmer in the area, who identified himself only as Biodun, said Lawal’s abduction created tension in the community, adding that a yet-to-be-identified passerby was hit by a bullet during the incident.  Related News   Delta gunmen kill INEC official, injure corps members  Six killed as gunmen attack another Anambra police station  Gunmen shoot Imo politician’s leg, victim hospitalised   
He said, “The man that was shot was rushed to a general hospital in the area from where they transferred him to the Ikorodu General Hospital for treatment. I can’t say whether he is alive or dead.
“Everybody, including farmers, residents and passersby, scampered for safety during the operation. They shot about three different times and it was when we returned to the scene of the attack that we realised that they came to kidnap the owner of the livestock farm.”
The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, said the incident happened in Ogun State, adding that the poultry was in Agbohun.
“The case was reported at the Imota Police Division in Lagos because of its proximity to the crime scene and I always tell my policemen that crime has no jurisdiction, and to the members of the public, police is police and there is a time limit in operation. If we arrest any suspects involved in the case, we will hand them over to the police in Ogun State,” he added.        
But the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the crime scene was under Imota, Lagos State.
He said, “The Divisional Police Officer covering that area said the scene of the incident falls under Imota in Lagos and that is why they did not report in any of our stations.”

Bandits in large numbers were said to have invaded the village on Monday night around 8 pm and abducted the man of God.
It was gathered that the bandits had invaded the same village, incidentally the hometown of the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Mathew Kukah, in the past where the traditional ruler of the Ikulu Chiefdom, who is Kukah’s brother, was abducted.
 
Although no official confirmation from either the state government or the state Command of the Nigeria Police, spokesperson of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union, Luka Binniyat, said the Catholic priest was kidnapped by bandits on Monday in his resident.
He said, “The siege on native communities in Zangon Kataf LGA is assuming a new dimension with clergy targeted for murder or kidnapped for ransom.
“The kidnap of the Parish Priest of St. Matthew’s Catholic Church, Anchuna village, the village home of the outspoken Bishop Hassan Mathew Kukah yesterday (Monday) is one more crime that SOKAPU views with strong suspicion of more grim crime planned against our people. And we warned of dire consequences if this is not immediately checked by the right authority.”      
Meanwhile, an 86-year-old woman, Mrs. Juliana Umoh, has cried that bandits were threatening to kill members of her families over a N20m ransom demanded by them.

Okoroafor, 21, was apprehended alongside one Egwuonwu Iyke, whom he reportedly connived with to abduct the boy and hold him captive.

Fwanshiwa said, “The FCE Pankshin students are presently not happy because one of our students, Felix Gele, popularly known as Flavour, has been kidnapped by gunmen suspected to be herdsmen.
“The victim is a 400-level(final year) student in the Department of Psychology.  Related News   Anger as gunmen kill 35 in Katsina, Kaduna  Gunmen attack Abuja estate, kidnap nine  Gunmen kill village head in Kano    
“From what I gathered, he was in his shop in Pankshin with a relative when the gunmen who pretended to be customers arrived at the place around 8pm on Wednesday.      
“One of the gunmen who first arrived at the shop actually bought bread from the shop, and while he was still there, another of his gang member came and asked for another item. It was while the student was trying to attend to the second person that the third gang member brandishing a gun suddenly appeared at the shop and ordered him and his relative to lie down. After they collected all the money they made from the shop that day, the gunmen asked the student to follow them, and since then, he has not been seen.”
A close friend of the kidnapped student who lamented the security situation in Pankshin said the gunmen had made contact with the family and demanded N5 million ransom.
The source said, “When the gunmen abducted the student, they called the wife and demanded N5 million ransom initially and later reduced the amount to N1 million. As it is, I don’t know where the wife of a student is going to get that kind of amount, and that’s why I am appealing to those holding him to show mercy and release my friend.”
The Spokesman for the State Police Command, Ubah Ogaba, when contacted promised to get back to our correspondent but he was yet to do so as of the time of filing this report"

Kidnappings of footballers and officials, as well as their relatives, have become a common occurrence in Nigeria, with Eguma the second NPFL coach to be kidnapped — after Abdulahi Biffo — in two years.
 
In February, Kabiru Mohammed, the bus driver of NPFL side, Adamawa United, was abducted by unknown gunmen and was released after six days after a ransom of N1m was paid to the abductors.
Last year, Super Eagles and Enyimba star Dayo Ojo was kidnapped alongside two others on the Benin-Owo expressway on his way to Akure following the suspension of the NPFL due to the outbreak of coronavirus in the country.

11th June 2021,"UPDATED: Bandits kill one, kidnap two lecturers, eight students in Nuhu Bamali Poly, Kaduna","A student has been confirmed dead while scores were abducted following bandits attack on the main campus of the Nuhu Bamali Polytechnic, Zaria, Kaduna State on Thursday night.
The bandits in large number were said to have invaded the main campus of the school at about 11.00pm and kidnapped no fewer than 10 persons – two lecturers and eight students.
It was gathered that the bandits raided the staff quarters of the school, shooting indiscriminately at anyone at sight.
The state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, after an on-the-spot assessment, confirmed the attack.
 
Aruwan said two of the students were hit by the bandits’ bullet, adding that one of the students identified as Ahmad Muhammad died of gunshot wounds.
He added that Haruna Dunniya, another student hit by a bullet was still receiving medical attention at an undisclosed hospital in the area.
The Commissioner said, “One student confirmed dead, one injured, and several kidnapped as armed bandits attack Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Zaria      
“The Kaduna State Government has been briefed by security agencies of an attack by bandits at the main campus of the Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Zaria, late on Thursday night.
“According to the briefing, the bandits invaded the staff quarters of the campus, shooting sporadically. In the process, two students were hit and sustained gunshot injuries. They were identified as Ahmad Muhammad and Haruna Isyaku Duniya
“They were rushed to the hospital for medical attention. Sadly, Ahmad Muhammad succumbed to his wounds and died early this morning. Haruna Isyaku Duniya is still receiving treatment.

He said Governor Nasir El-Rufai was sad on receiving the briefing on the latest attack on a school in the state.
Meanwhile, as of the time of filing this report, senior government officials and security operatives were assessing the situation.
The attack was coming barely 24 hours after State Directors of the Department of State Services in the northwest zone converged in the state to brainstorm on the disturbing spate of insecurity in the zone.        
At the event, Aruwan had stressed the need for inter-agency collaboration among security agencies to tackle the current security challenges not only in the state but the entire zone.
He had noted that some of the attacks would have been averted if there was synergy among the security agencies in the fight against banditry and kidnapping and other related crimes ravaging the zone.
The Commissioner, therefore, enjoined the various security agencies – DSS, Police, military and other paramilitary agencies to work together in order to flush out bandits and other related criminal elements.
He had said, “Our appeal to you today is that we all imbibe more than ever the essence of sharing and teamwork. In security management, every element is important, and in our situation, every Command is part of a system.
“As it is commonly said, “teamwork makes the dream work.” Each one brings a crucial piece to the intelligence puzzle, especially in these times when the challenges have blurred state lines and operate with no delineation between our territories.
“The underlying psychology which we as State Governments and State Commands must work with at this time is that of “One Team, One Fight.”
“Our states must work as one team because our fight has clearly become one fight. Anything less than a fully collaborative spirit may turn our best efforts into liabilities instead of assets to the entire security architecture.      
“From our intelligence gathering, we have discovered that (and it is important for us to keep this in mind) criminals, bandits and terrorists are now collaborating more to devastating effect. If they do, then should we not, as states, do the same?”"

Haske quarters, behind Stanel Oil, is the same community where gunmen last month kidnapped a Professor and her husband and later released them after allegedly collecting ransom.

Gyang said, “What happened last night in Haske quarters was terrible. It was the sounds of gunshots that woke us up around 2am. But we could not come out when it became clear that Haske quarters was under attack by gunmen.

It’s really painful because this thing is happening again in the same place where a professor and her husband were kidnapped in similar circumstances last month and Dr Ella who is their neighbour was the one running around to make sure that the kidnapped husband and wife were rescued. And now, he is the one that has been abducted and no one knows where they have taken him to.”      
The Chairman of the University of Jos branch of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, Dr Lazarus Maigoro also confirmed the abduction of the lecturer.
Maigoro who condemned the development said, “It’s true because I just received an official report on the kidnap of one of our members in Lamingo Area last night. I’m preparing a press release on the incident.
“Something has to be done about this kidnapping of innocent people because it’s really sad and should not be allowed to continue.”

26th May 2021,Gunmen kidnap IYC president in Rivers,"GUNMEN have kidnapped the President of the Ijaw Youths Council, Worldwide, Peter Igbifa, in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital.
It was learnt that Igbifa was kidnapped on Tuesday morning along the Port Harcourt International Airport Road by a group of armed masked men.
Though details of his abduction were still sketchy, it was gathered that the IYC president had sent a message to his driver informing of his abduction.
Igbifa also asked the driver to tell the youths to go on with a planned protest, saying, “Nobody can infringe on the rights of the Niger Delta people.”
 
When contacted, IYC Chairman, Action Committee, Strategy, Planning and Programmes, Israel Fubara, said the council had just received the news.
“It is information that we got. But we are making our findings. We have already put machinery in place to see how we can actually know what happened. So, we are investigating.”
He further said the Ijaw youths had planned to shut down the region, saying, “Likely today (Tuesday) midnight, then action can begin because we wanted to exhaust the time limit before we can stage our action.”        Related News   Delta gunmen kill INEC official, injure corps members  Six killed as gunmen attack another Anambra police station  Gunmen shoot Imo politician’s leg, victim hospitalised   
Asked if he has an idea of what would have led to the kidnap, he said the IYC had given the Presidency a 30-day ultimatum to constitute a substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission.
“We will liken the NDDC to the North-East Commission. But the politics played in NDDC can never be imagined in the North-East Commission,” Fubara added.
When contacted, the Rivers State Police Public Relations Officer, Nnamdi Omoni, said, “Yes, I can confirm that he was abducted along the Airport Road. When we got the information, we deployed our technical intelligence to make sure that his whereabouts is known and for him to reunite with his family.”

15th May 2021,How we were kidnapped behind police station  –Enugu estate agents,"Two Enugu-based estate agents – Mazi Uchechukwugeme Abonyi and Aja Uchenna Michael – tell RAPHAEL EDE about their four-day ordeal in the den of Fulani kidnappers
What is your name and what do you do for a living?
My name is Mazi Uchechukwugeme Abonyi. I am a real estate agent.
You and two others were kidnapped sometime last month. Can you us how it happened?
 
In the morning of April 9, 2021 I went to Amokpo Nike with two of my friends, Uche Aja and Emeka Ijegara, to inspect a piece of land for a client. The land is at the back of Unity Police Station opposite Elime Estate Enugu. We had inspected and videoed the 10 plots of land and were about to leave around 9.30am, when I saw about five heavily-armed guys running towards us.
In shock, I shouted, ‘Jesus!’ They told me that if I moved they would ‘pin me to the ground with a bullet.’ But I started running and suddenly felt something hit me and I fell down. I saw my friend, Uche Aja, fighting with one of them but they stabbed him. Eventually, they brought the three of us together and began to march us away. We were made to trek and jog in the thick forest for about six hours non-stop. The forest was so thick, one could hardly see the sky. I have heard of Sambisa forest in the North, but I   never knew there is a forest like that in Enugu.  We were climbing and descending from mountains. From around 9.30am when the journey began we didn’t stop moving until about 3pm. Meanwhile, these guys were beating and pushing us to run. Whenever we said we were tired and wanted to rest, they hit us with their guns. It was a terrible experience. When we finally stopped moving, they ordered us to lie down.
What happened afterwards?      
They gave us our phones, which they had earlier collected. They said we were going to a mountain to make calls to our people and inform them that we had been kidnapped. They said we should tell our people that they would pay a ransom of N7m on each of us. When they said that, we began to cry. We told them our people had no such money and we were guys just struggling to survive, working as real estate agents. They said that was none of their business; it was either N7m each or our lives.
They ordered us to start moving again. We got to a very big river and they told us that was where they killed people and threw their body inside water if their relatives failed to respond fast enough.
At that point we were made to call our people. We were made to tell our people to be fast in bringing the money as the kidnappers had shown us where they killed people when there was a delay in the payment of ransom.
Were your families able to raise the money?
Yes, but they negotiated and agreed on N2m.
How was the ransom delivered to the kidnappers?
Where they kept us was about eight hours’ walk to from the main road. After our families finally raised the money and arranged for someone to bring it, the kidnappers moved us closer to the main road. They ordered us to lie down on the ground while two of them went to collect the ransom from the person bringing it. The two leaders instructed the remaining three others they left with us to kill us if they didn’t return. But they returned shortly later and one of two asked us, ‘Who is Uche Abonyi among you?’ I indicated I was the one, thinking that our people had paid the ransom and it was time for me and my friends to go. But he ordered me to move aside and lie down. He said he would shoot me for inviting the DSS and police anti-kidnap unit. He said policemen could have killed him if not that they were clumsy in their shootings. He said since he escaped being killed, he would kill me and send my dead body to my brother to teach him a lesson not to call the police next time.        
What did you do when he said that?
I started pleading with him, asking him to give me another chance. I begged the guy to forgive my brother. I said my brother could not have brought the police to attack him. I tried everything to convince him not to kill me. After some time, he said I had only one chance to get someone else to deliver the money to them. He said he didn’t know why something was telling him not to shoot me because the normal thing they did if anyone called the police for them was to kill the victim. He said in my case something was telling him not to shoot me. I pleaded with him to please listen to that thing and spare my life.
I asked my friend, Emeka, to make the call and arrange for someone else, who knows the terrain, to bring the ransom. It was that person who brought the ransom to them. They freed us to go after they got the ransom.

What is your name?
My name is Aja Uchenna Michael  Related News   Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi  Gunmen kidnap Taraba monarch’s wives, son  Woman lures four-year-old to kidnappers, Rivers police arrest suspects   
Can you briefly narrate your encounter with the kidnappers?
As my friend had said, we were abducted around 9am on Friday, April 9 when we went to inspect a piece of land. When I heard him (Abonyi) shout ‘Jesus!’ I was shocked and asked him what happened.  On turning around,  I saw a Fulani man carrying an AK-47 rifle, running towards us. Out of fear we dispersed, running in different directions. Little did we know that they (kidnappers) were five in number and they had already taken positions. As I was running, I tripped over something and fell down. I stood up and continued running and then I noticed that someone was chasing me. The person overtook me, pointed a pistol at me and ordered me to go back. I was scared. When he saw that I wasn’t moving, he brought out his machete and started swinging it in my face. As I was telling him I couldn’t go back there, he hit me twice on the hand with the machete. I had to start defending myself.      
I rushed at him and started struggling with him for the control of the gun. As we were both struggling, one of the gang members came and pointed his gun to my head. So, at that point, I had to surrender, seeing they had overpowered me.
They took me to where they kept my friends and started threatening to kill us. They pointed at me particularly, saying they would kill me for attacking their brother. They took our wallets, removed our money and returned the wallets to us.  Then they marched us into the forest. We walked inside the forest for over six hours non-stop. The kidnappers must have been on drugs because we couldn’t keep up with their pace and they kept hitting us with machete, knife, anything in their hands. The funny thing is that these people know the terrain too well. It is like they demarcated area and avoided paths that might lead to where people are. They were communicating among themselves by whistling. We were completely in the thick forest and we couldn’t even see the sky.
What did they do to you in the forest?
After we stopped moving in the evening and they ordered us to call our people, they led us to a different location where we could get water. We drink the water there happily because we were highly dehydrated already. In the night, we slept in the forest. And then the next morning, as early as 4am, they woke us up and moved us to another location. As a matter of fact, we never spent more than three hours in a particular location. That shows you how professional these people are.
Were you fed by the kidnappers?
They didn’t give us anything like food or snacks for the four days that we were in their den. We were just drinking water – we drank whatever water we could find for those four days.
If you are given security, can you trace the place in the forest where you were kept for those four days?  
No. We were not kept in a single location to start with. And if they had left us in that forest to find our way out, we wouldn’t have been able to get out by ourselves.
How do you know that your kidnappers were Fulani?
They spoke Fulani (language), they dressed like Fulani people. I grew up in a place where some Fulani people settled; so, I know them when I see them.
What type of guns did they carry?
They carried military-like guns. I saw AK-49 and pump-action guns – very heavy weapons. They also had daggers and machetes.
Are you by any means saying that those kidnappers might have military background? 
I don’t know how they came across those weapons and I don’t think they were soldiers; but then I know that for them to access those weapons, they must either have connections in high places or they killed military personnel and collected their rifles.

It was also gathered that the hoodlums whisked the students into the forest shortly after they ambushed them while journeying on a bus along Okigwe-Uturu Road.
The Commissioner for Information in the state, John Kalu, confirmed the development in a statement on Thursday, saying that two of the students escaped from the clutches of the hoodlums while others were still being held hostage by the criminals.
The statement read, “Abia State Government is currently monitoring an incident that happened in Okigwe, Imo State, yesterday which led to the suspected abduction of yet to be determined number of students of the Abia State University, Uturu, who apparently ran into a yet to be identified gang of hoodlums operating along the Okigwe-Uturu Road.

30th April 2021,"Bandits kill 323, kidnap 949 in three months in Kaduna - Commissioner","The Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said on Friday that no fewer than 323 persons were killed and 949 kidnapped by bandits across the state in the last three months.
The Commissioner, while giving a security report in the state first quarter of 2021, also said military troops neutralised 64 bandits and arrested several gunrunners in the state.
According to Aruwan, the report covers banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling, attacks, and reprisal attacks.
He noted that of the 323 people killed during the period under review, 20 were women and 11 were minors while
292 were males.
 
The Commissioner said, “The report also includes the aerial missions conducted over identified bandit hideouts and locations across the state, during which multiple scores of bandits were engaged and neutralised with their camps destroyed.
“Deaths linked to banditry, violent attacks, communal clashes, and reprisals in the first quarter total 323 across the state. Of this, 20 were women and 11 were minors.
“Out of the 323 citizens killed, 292 were males. 236 of the recorded deaths occurred in Birnin Gwari, Chikun, Igabi, Giwa, and Kajuru LGAs.      
“Birnin Gwari recorded the highest figure of 77 deaths, followed by Chikun with 52, Igabi 45, Giwa 42, Kajuru 20 deaths in the first quarter.
“Southern Kaduna Senatorial District had 68 deaths in total, of which five were women and two below the age of 18.

“Kajuru had 28 deaths, followed by Zangon Kataf with 14 and Kagarko with 12
“And the Northern senatorial zone is the least affected with 19 people killed and Zaria has the highest casualty of six.
“As earlier highlighted, 64 armed bandits were neutralised during engagements with ground forces.”
Meanwhile, some of the bandits were neutralized by the military through about 150 targeted aerial missions conducted by the Nigerian Air Force.
Aruwan said scores of gunrunners were intercepted while 36 AK47 Rifles, 1959 rounds of live ammunition and one rocket-propelled grenade were recovered.        
He said, “Multiple scores of bandits were neutralised via about 150 targeted aerial missions conducted by the Nigerian Air Force. These missions were initiated based on Credible intelligence of bandit activity and locations of camps, which were targeted and destroyed.
“Several gunrunners have been intercepted and arrested with arms and ammunition recovered in the first quarter. 36 AK47 Rifles, 1959 rounds of live ammunition, and one rocket-propelled grenade were recovered.
“Vigorous investigations are ongoing towards dismantling more gun-running networks and block arms routes into the state, as these are central to the perpetuation of violence and armed banditry, through the trade in small arms and light weapons.
“The Kaduna State government reiterates its empathy towards individuals and groups who have suffered a terrible loss and untold hardship as a result of violence and insecurity, and of its resolve to intensify efforts towards enduring peace and security across the state.”"
28th April 2021,"35 members killed, 145 kidnapped in four months – Kaduna Baptist","NO fewer than 35 persons have been killed while 145 members of the Baptist Church were kidnapped by bandits in Kaduna State with the past four months.
The Kaduna Baptist Conference disclosed this on Tuesday in Kaduna
This was just at the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union condemned the attack on the Haske Baptist Church, Kuriga ward in Chikun Local Government Area of the state.
In that attack, a medical doctor attached to the state Ministry of Health, Dr. Zakariya Dogon Yaro, was killed by the bandits while her daughter, Rose and three others were kidnapped by the hoodlums.
 
SOKAPU’s spokesman, Luka Binniyat in a statement titled, ‘Coalition of Boko Haram/armed herdsmen inching towards Kaduna town’, said the attack was meant to incite religious riot.
Binniyat said, “The brazen impunity with which these outlaws operate is shocking and getting scarier. Though hundreds of churches have been burnt or destroyed and abandoned in these areas, last Sunday’s attack on peaceful, harmless congregation of Haske Baptist Church, Manini, in Kuriga ward is most appalling and condemnable.
“The desecration of the church and the coldblooded murder of a medical doctor, Dr Zakaria Dogon Yaro and the abduction of his daughter, Rose Zakariya, and three others was an attempt to incite and spark a religious riot. But our members would never be driven to do that and SOKAPU hails the law abiding and peaceful nature of the Gbagyi people.”        Related News   Kaduna terrorists kill pastor’s son, community leader laments abductions  Rivers police arrest four women for allegedly abducting infant  Nasarawa police arrest six suspected kidnappers, recover arms

The group commended the Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello for sheltering the Internally Displaced Persons from Chikun Local Government Area of the state.
Meanwhile, the President, Kaduna Baptist Conference, Rev. Ishaya Jangado, who spoke to newsmen on in Kaduna on Tuesday, said on daily basis its members were either kidnapped or killed in Buruku, Gadani, Gwagwada, Kasuwan Magani, Kakau, Sabon-Tasha and Udawa.

How were you abducted?
Five of us were abducted on the onion farm in Tulhun Maya village near Baga, where we were weeding, when the insurgents came. When they got to us, they asked us if we were from Baga town and we answered in the affirmative, and they said that our parents and brothers had mobilised against them and as such, they would take us away in retaliation for what our parents had done to them. They took us on motorcycles and rode into the bush; we rode for a long distance in the bush until we got to the river; then, they parked the bikes and used a canoe to paddle through the river to the other side. After crossing over, we trekked for some distance before arriving at a village.

The village was deserted between the borders of Nigeria and Chad. The journey from where they abducted us to the village was rough and tough. It took us almost the whole day to arrive at our destination. We left the farm, where they abducted us from, around 8am, but arrived at the camp in the village around 4pm.
How will you describe the location you were taken to?
The location is a village that was destroyed by Boko Haram insurgents, leading to the villagers deserting the place. The Boko Haram insurgents are the only people occupying the village. There are so many destroyed buildings there; the insurgents use those destroyed houses as camps. They operate freely in that village with their flag hoisted high. When we got to the village, they gave us a room that had only a mat that served as our mattress all through our stay in that camp.      
Can you recount your experience while in captivity?
On the first day we arrived in the village, they gave us food but we refused to eat. On the second day, they came to us and met us crying and they then forced us to eat. One of them then said if we refused to eat, they would kill us and immediately, one of them shot in the air to scare us, and they said we should stop crying and eat. That was how we started. For the period of time I was in that camp, I did not cook food; it was some old women, who were kidnapped and whom we met there that were cooking for us.
In that place, there were hundreds of old women and young girls who were kidnapped before us. We were living freely and they treated us with respect, except that we were not free to leave. Whatever thing we asked for was given to us. All we did was sleep, wake up, play and go back to sleep. I got tired of this routine and I decided to engage myself in some chores, so when I woke up in the morning, I would enter the nearby bush and fetch firewood and bring it to the camp. When we first got there was a security man attached to us, but as time went by, the security man left us alone.  Related News   29 Borno fishermen killed, nine injured in Boko Haram attack — Police  Suspected Boko Haram terrorists kill 29 fishermen in Borno  Suspected cultists gang-rape Rivers pastor’s wife to death   
When were you abducted and how long did you stay in the camp?
I was abducted sometime in 2015 during the Ramadan and I stayed in the camp for over a year. I escaped in 2016. I was 14 years old when they abducted me, now I am 21 years old. While I was there, I was fortunate that none of them had sex with me. In fact I came out the way I was abducted. My only regret is that I could not continue with my education. I was in JSS1 when I was abducted, and when I came out, I couldn’t go back to school.
How did you escape?
For the period of time I was there, we studied their movement; we were allowed all the freedom to do whatever we wanted to do; so, on this fateful day, I told the four other girls that we should escape and they all agreed. In the morning around 8am we went out as if we were going to fetch firewood; from there, we found our way.        
We walked aimlessly in the bush until we got to a village, where we met two persons and we told them our ordeal; the people hid us in their house and told us that the insurgents would come looking for us and they did come searching for us. When they left, the people took us through the bush path and showed us the route until we got to another village. In that village, we explained to them what happened to us and they immediately mobilised and gave us N1,500 as transport fare and took us to the park;  we boarded a Gwoza bound car. That was how we escaped from that bush after over a year with the terrorists.
When we got to Gwoza, we were immediately conveyed to Maiduguri and on getting to Maiduguri, my mother, who was living in the CAN IDP camp took me to hospital for a  check-up, but I was certified okay and discharged.

11th April 2021,Seven Catholic clergy kidnapped in Haiti,"Seven Catholic clergy, including two French citizens, were kidnapped Sunday in Haiti, said the spokesman of the Bishop’s Conference for the island nation, which has been rocked by unrest.
Five priests and two nuns were abducted in the morning in Croix-des-Bouquets, a commune northeast of the capital Port-au-Prince, while they were “on their way to the installation of a new parish priest,” Father Loudger Mazile told AFP.
The kidnappers had demanded a $1 million ransom for the group, which includes one French priest and one French nun, he added.
Haitian authorities suspect an armed gang called “400 Mawozo” — which is active in kidnappings — is behind the abduction, according to a police source.
 
The French embassy in Haiti did not respond to AFP’s request for comment.
Kidnappings for ransom have surged in recent months in Port-au-Prince and other provinces, reflecting the growing influence of armed gangs in the Caribbean nation.  Related News   Suspected cultists gang-rape Rivers pastor’s wife to death  Two abducted clerics regain freedom in Plateau  Why do we disrespect Haiti?   
“This is too much. The time has come for these inhuman acts to stop,” Bishop Pierre-Andre Dumas of the Haitian commune Miragoane told AFP.      
“The Church prays and stands in solidarity with all the victims of this heinous act.”
In March, the Haitian government declared a month-long state of emergency to restore state authority in gang-controlled areas, including in the capital.
The measure was motivated by the actions of armed gangs who “kidnap people for ransom, openly declaring it, steal and loot public and private property, and openly confront the public security forces,” according to the presidential decree.

The statement read, “The APC observed that the action of those, who are still holding the caretaker committee chairman of Khana hostage without any trace, has confirmed that ordinary citizens resident in Rivers State are not safe.
“We have been briefed that he was taken into captivity at a time when well-meaning people were celebrating the resurrection of our Lord, the son of God. While the identities of the persons, who are currently holding him hostage, are not known, we have strong reasons to believe that the act was perpetuated against the backdrop of the inability of the Rivers State Government to guarantee appropriate security protection at the grassroots.

4th April 2021,"How those in power are fuelling banditry, kidnapping -Bishop Kukah","Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Kukah, has blamed “those in power” for the increasing cases of banditry, kidnapping, terrorism and armed robbery in the country.
He said this in his 2021 Easter message titled, ‘Before our glory departs’, on Sunday.
According to him, banditry and kidnapping are increasing because those in power pay more attention to rehabilitating bandits and kidnappers than the victims.
Bishop expressed concern over the killing of security operatives and the “helplessness” of the citizens.
 
He said, “Taunted by Boko Haram, ravaged by bandits, kidnappers, armed robbers, and other merchants of death across the nation, there is collective fear as to whether Nigeria’s glory is about to depart! Retired military and intelligence officers lament over what has become of their glorious profession as they watch the humiliation of our military personnel.
“Traumatised citizens are tortured daily by bandits. The nation has since become a massive killing field, as both government and the governed look on helplessly.
“A thick and suffocating cloud of desperation, despondency, desolation, gloom, and misery hangs in the hot air. We have no message and have no idea how long this will last. Our people seek solace and protection, but frustration and darkness threaten to drown them. Is their government on AWOL?        Related News   Banditry: APC campaign rally turns prayer session  Nigeria needs credible election, says Kukah  Kukah’s gospel truth to Buhari   
“Sadly, human life is haemorrhaging so badly in Nigeria, but the greatest tragedy is the death of empathy from those in power. Mysteriously, the government is investing billions of naira in rehabilitating so-called Boko Haram repentant members and their other partners in crime in the belief that they want to turn a new leaf.
“These criminals have waged war against their country, murdered thousands of citizens, destroyed infrastructure and rendered entire families permanently displaced and dislocated. Why should rehabilitating the perpetrator be more important than bringing succour to the victims?
“When kidnapped or killed, victims and their families are left to their wits. They cry alone, bury their loved ones alone. And our government expects us to be patriotic? The victims of violence need empathy, which the dictionary defines as the ability to understand and share the feelings of the other.
“A critical deficit of empathy on the side of the government makes healing almost impossible for the victims. We have not heard anything about a rehabilitation programme for the thousands of schoolchildren who have been victims of abduction.

4th April 2021,"Boko Haram: 200 traders killed, kidnapped, raped in three months, group alleges","Over 200 market women in the North-East have been kidnapped, raped and, in some cases, killed by Boko Haram insurgents since January 2021, the Forum of North East Market Women said on Saturday.
Expressing sorrow that they had been out of business as a result of insecurity in the region, the forum appealed to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to expedite action against the insurgents as some of its displaced members had fallen into drug use.
“We also wish to kindly appeal to the federal and state governments to urgently initiate programmes that will rehabilitate victims of drug abuse, especially women in the North-East,” the FNEMW said in a statement by its Chairperson, Mariam Bulama; and Secretary, Zainab Gadzama.
They also lamented the activities of Boko Haram in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states, claiming that “our sources of livelihood have been taken away as a result of the insurgency.”
 
The statement read, “The situation has assumed an alarming dimension since January 2021, with 200 or more of our members kidnapped, raped and even, sometimes, killed on their way to the local markets in search of daily bread.

“We have been going through these pains for some time now but the dimension the insurgency has taken from January to date is extremely alarming. Worse still, some members of security agencies have taken over our core fish business. This act of hopelessness has led so many of our women to turn to drug addiction for temporary succour.
“No part of Borno, Yobe or Adamawa, apart from their capital cities, is safe as of today and we wonder why there is silence about the atrocities being carried out here by the terrorists. We strongly feel that some powerful forces in charge of security in the North-East are deliberately compromising the war against the adversaries.”

2nd April 2021,"How China-based bizman was abducted, died in kidnappers’ den, ransom collected","A special tactical squad of the Akwa Ibom State Police Command on Monday, March 29, 2021, stormed a kidnappers’ hideout in Mbiaso community, in the Nsit Ibom Local Government Area of the state.
The operatives, who killed three of the hoodlums during a gun battle, also exhumed the body of a businessman buried in the hideout.
The deceased, Onyeaka Ezewulu, was reportedly shot by the hoodlums while attempting to run when they invaded his house on Idoro Road, Uyo.
A source told our correspondent that Onyeka, who died after losing much blood, was buried in a shallow grave after the kidnappers collected N2m ransom from his family.

The source said the kidnappers’ hideout and the grave were discovered following detailed investigation by the police team, led by one CSP Julian Igbodu.
A suspect, Deborah Sunday, who assisted the police in locating the hideout, told journalists that three members of her gang abducted Onyeka on March 5, 2021.      
She explained that the victim was shot in his right leg when he attempted to run, adding that he was bundled into a Toyota Camry and taken to their hideout.

A brother to the deceased, Patrick, said the China-based businessman, who dealt in exotic boxes and clothes, wanted to check on his family and business outlets in the state when he was attacked.
“Unknown to us, the hoodlums had already killed Onyeka before we paid them the N2m on March 10, 2021. That was why after the payment was made to them, we waited for days to see him regain his freedom, all to no avail.
“We didn’t know he actually died a day after he was kidnapped. That was four days before we paid the ransom,” he added.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko MacDon, described the incident as unfortunate and sad, and appealed to members of the public to provide useful information on criminal activities in their domains.        
He lauded the tactical team for the feat, adding that the three kidnappers who attempted to escape on sighting the police were killed during a gun duel with the police team.

Adebayo Ayinde, Minna
Barely 48 hours after an attack on the Raffi-Kotangora Road, bandits on Tuesday embarked on a daring broad daylight raid on some communities in Niger State and killed 10 persons and abducted 24 others.
This was just as the state government confirmed the killing of the village head of Kusherki in the Rafi Local Government Area of the state, Alhaji Masud Abubakar, by the bandits, who also abducted his wife.
 
Five of those killed were said to be members of the local vigilante group, while the others were young boys said to be supporting the vigilantes.
The raid, according to eyewitnesses, began around 12.30pm and lasted till around 2pm.
According to reports, the bandits numbering over 50 rode on motorcycles and operated with sophisticated weapons, including AK-47 rifles.      
Eyewitnesses said the bandits began their operation from Kasuwe village and moved to other villages killing and maiming innocent villagers.
The bandits also dispossessed the villagers of food items and other valuables.
It was gathered that during the attack, a helicopter hovered in the air to allegedly give the bandits protection.
Another set of bandits, according to sources, blocked the major highway leading to Minna from Sarkin Pawa, leaving motorists to run helter-skelter.
The Secretary to the Local Government Council, Mr James Jagaba, confirmed the attack but said, “I cannot give you details. My vigilante corps members are still battling with the bandits I have yet to get a report from them.”
A state government statement, which confirmed the Kusherki incident, did not say when it happened, but lamented that the increasing activities of kidnappers and bandits in the state were becoming a nightmare to the people.  Related News   Bandits killed 300 persons, kidnapped 200 in Niger January attacks – Gov  Two hunters missing, gunmen killed as insurgents, residents battle in Niger  Again, bandits hit Niger, kill 30, Kaduna shuts phone services   
The statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mary Noel-Berje, described the situation “as callous and regrettable,” adding that “the murder of the traditional title holder is a challenge to the security agencies to intensify their search to fish out and ensure that the perpetrators of such heinous acts are brought to justice.”        
“The situation, particularly in the last 72 hours, has become regrettably alarming! While efforts are ongoing to secure the release of the abducted NSTA passengers, we heard that of Kusherki and other areas. We are witnessing these attacks now almost on a daily basis and it is worrisome,” the statement quoted Governor Abubakar Bello as saying.
Meanwhile, the Niger State Government has claimed that it has rescued 10 out of the 21 travellers abducted last week in Kundu via Yakila, Rafi Local Government Area of the state.
The Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mohammad Idris, made this known in an interview on Tuesday at the General Hospital where three of the rescued victims were examined.
“Immediately after the incident, the state government gave an assurance to rescue them and they were rescued through multiply strategies. I assure you that Governor Abubakar Bello’s administration will not rest until the other victims are rescued,” he stated.
Idris denied allegation of payment of N50m as ransom by the state government to secure the release of the victims, saying the strategies employed in rescuing the victims could not be revealed, adding that if ransom was paid, all of the abducted passengers would have been released by the abductors.
The commissioner sympathised with the families of the victims, adding that the governor had come up with strategies in collaboration with neighbouring states to fight bandits and other criminals in the state considering the position of Niger State in the North-Central region.
The Managing Director of the hospital, Ma-ali Isah, said three of the victims, consisting of two adults and a child, were brought for examination and confirmed that they were stable.      
“Three of the recently abducted victims were brought in this afternoon, two adults and a child; they have been examined and they are in a stable condition,” he said.

26th January 2021,"How  Fulani seized our farms, raped our women, kidnapped and  killed our people  – Convener, Igangan Development Advocates, Oladokun","The Convener of the Igangan Development Advocates, Mr Oladiran Oladokun, who is also a farmer, tells OLUFEMI OLANIYI the genesis of the crisis in Igangan and other parts of Ibarapaland, Oyo State and suggests the way out of it
Can you trace the genesis of the herdsmen crisis in Igangan?
The crisis has been going on for years and what happened last week, I think, was a reaction to the agelong issues of oppression of the host community by the Fulani herdsmen. The Fulani way of life and the culture of dominating and oppressing their hosts caused the problem. They have committed a lot of atrocities against our people, I mean the indigenes of Igangan and even the entire Ibarapaland.
What are the atrocities?
 
They started with frequent plundering of farms. It became so bad that at least three or four cases of farm destruction would be reported at the police station everyday. The people are farmers and destroying their only means of livelihood is like killing them. This has been going on for more than 15 years and people became used to it.
At what point did kidnapping come in?
I think they realised that they could make huge money quickly with kidnapping and that was when they introduced kidnapping and armed robbery. Seriki Salihu Abdukadir has been fingered to be behind some wicked acts against the indigenes on many occasions. Anytime any offence was committed, the  Seriki would be the one defending the arrested Fulani.      
READ ALSO: Bauchi auditor general’s son, friend’s kidnappers demand N30m
Offences like what?
Offences like farm plundering, rape, kidnapping and so on, Seriki would be the one defending the Fulani that were caught. He would be the one who would make sure that they were not prosecuted. He would throw his weight behind those arrested. Seriki and his sons were the ones accusing Amotekun of killing his people  when they came to some settlements to fight kidnappers. That happened recently.
Are you saying he compromised the police to let the offenders go scot-free?
It may not be like that but he has influence. It may not be in the police in the state alone. I believe he has influence above (Abuja). What can a commissioner of police do if he or she is given an order by the superior? We don’t know who he is connected to but he has strong connection and influence.
You mentioned rape among the crimes allegedly committed by herdsmen. Was there any time this happened?
We have had many rape cases,  but I cannot go on and be mentioning their names because it will reopen their wounds. There was a woman that was raped in Igangan by Fulani. There are cases of attack, killings and many atrocities being committed against the people. Those criminals are always shielded.        
My brother, Sola Akintola was attacked on his farm by herdsmen. He went to his farm  with labourers and they harvested cassava in large quantities. After they had loaded some pickup vans, he waited behind for the vehicles to come back and load the remaining. While he was there on the farm alone, the herdsmen came with a large number of cattle and he asked them to take their cattle to another part to feed them but they insisted that their animals would be fed with the cassava he harvested and was waiting to be transported to the market. Can you believe that? He resisted them and they attacked him. Their swords could not harm him so they started beating him with their rods and clubs until they battered the hand he was using to defend his head.
Why did he not report the case to the police?
He did.  The police saw that he could die if he was not treated immediately so they wrote down his name and asked him to go to hospital. After that, the police came from the area command to arrest those who attacked him because he knows them. The police said they would arrest him on a particular date at Kara market, they came but could not arrest him.  The case was attempted murder but they could not arrest the suspects.
[YOU MAY ALSO LIKE] Igangan/Fulani crisis: Town presents evidence, alleges herders collected N50m ransoms, raped 15 women
How?
They came and he went with the policemen to where Konga, the master of those who attacked him was. The policemen could not arrest him because the Fulani came out with weapons. The policemen had to go back. If you are an indigene of the place and your brother narrowly survived such a vicious attack and nothing was done to the criminals, will that not discourage you from going to the farm?  We have two Serikis: Seriki Ego who is the Seriki Bororo and  Seriki Salihu. Bororo is just a sub-ethnic Fulani group, but there is nothing that happens among the Fulani that Seriki Salihu is not aware of.  When our own farm was destroyed, it was Seriki’s son  that came to defend the Fulani men that did it.
But why do you think he allegedly defends criminal herdsmen?      
I think it’s against their culture to point out criminals among them or anyone that does anything wrong. Seriki has never done that. He has never condemned criminality among the Fulani. He will always defend them and this makes us to believe he knows about everything happening.
But Seriki said those perpetrating crimes were not his people. He said some people come from Zamfara State, Kebbi State and other areas. …
Wherever a Fulani man comes from, they are his brothers. The Fulani will come and attach themselves to those here. They won’t come and be living there without the knowledge of Seriki. Even if a Fulani man comes and acquires land from our people, Seriki will still be involved; so he cannot say the Fulani come from Zamfara and he doesn’t know them.
The Oyo State House of Assembly passed an anti-open grazing bill. Do you think this will stop the crisis when it is signed into law?
Yes, it will, but I don’t know why the governor has not signed it into law. The bill is still just like a proposal despite its passage by the lawmakers until the governor signs it and makes it a law. Whatever is delaying it should be quickly resolved and let it become operational. They should deploy security personnel to enforce the law and they should be well equipped for the job. After that anybody that violates the law should be arrested and prosecuted.  Related News   Five arrested for serial abduction of women, victims’ rape  I’ve raped 50 women, robbed 100 houses – Ondo serial rapist  Igangan vs Fulani: Implement El-Rufai committee report, PGF DG urges APC, FG   
Is Igangan a border community?
It is not. But it has a very large amount of uncultivated forest and the Fulani migrate through the bush most times. If you know how to manoeuvre like them, you can get to the Benin Republic from the bush there. But if you go on the road, there are many communities you will get to within Nigeria.  
Is there a mining site in Igangan?
I am not aware of any mining site in Igangan. But if there is, it could be an illegal mining site. If you are referring to what Seriki said, it is his way of shifting blame. He is very skilful at that but he can no longer fool us.
How did Sunday Igboho come to the scene?
I believe the atrocities being committed by the herdsmen got to him and he came. He came to find out and went to visit the traditional rulers and they told him that they were tired of the wickedness of these people and helpless. They asked for his help against the killing, raping, kidnapping and destruction of farms by Fulani people. It was a clarion call sent to Chief Sunday Igboho because the government failed to listen to us. He did not just go to visit Seriki, he asked for permission and he was given.
READ ALSO: Herders’ registration begins, NGF, Miyetti Allah back Akeredolu’s order
You accused the government of not listening to your people. Have you reported the problem in the area to the state government?
We have informed the government of the security problem several times. In 2019, I personally submitted a letter to the governor and I copied the speaker of the House of Assembly, and I also sent copies to the lawmaker from our constituency Hon. B.T. Ojedokun. That was in July 2019.  Before the gruesome murder of  Dr Fatai in December 2020, we took another step and submitted another letter to let the government know what is happening to our people. Some of those leaders believed that what we were saying was exaggerated and this showed in the broadcast by the governor. We staged a protest after Dr Aborode was killed.      
Who killed Dr Aborode?
From reports from eyewitnesses including his manager and all what had happened before then, Fulani herdsmen killed him.
Why?
He owns a very large expanse of land which he used for agricultural purposes. The farm is very large and the Fulani are not comfortable with this. One thing the Fulani here hate most is seeing land owners cultivating their land. They would do everything to send you out. They want to drive out all farmers from their farms and that is why we have been crying out but our cry was not heeded. So seeing Dr Fatai Aborode owning such a large farm is a big headache to them. They know that such will motivate other indigenes to go back to cultivate their land but they detest this. It will shock you that as they are driving away our people from the land, they are taking over the land and cultivating it. But it is interesting that when they plant, a single cow will not stray to eat anything on their farm. So, you will now realise that the daily destruction of our farms is deliberate. They drive our people out by destroying their farms and attacking them and they are taking over. They plant and bring their produce to the market for us to buy.
So, the Fulani grow crops apart from breeding cattle?
They do. They produce crops in large quantities after driving away our people. If you have a farm near theirs, you won’t harvest it. Their cattle will destroy everything.

They are not indigenes of Igangan. How did they get land in the area?
Our people are hospitable like other Yoruba. They gave some of them a piece of land to just build their huts because we are hospitable but our hospitality is working against us now. Some who don’t cultivate their land inheritance would give it to the Fulani to use but they are regretting it now.
My father before he died could no longer  go to the farm because of these Fulani people. Nobody could go and farm there and the land was left fallow for about 15 years before my brothers and I decided to go back to farming. The land is left uncultivated for a long time and the Fulani would start growing crops there. When they were challenged they would plead with you that they just needed a small portion of it to grow things to feed their families. After a while, they would make sure they did not allow you to return there again even if you want to start cultivating it.
 At times, the Fulani would offer money to some people and they would buy land . That also happens.
The Miyetti Allah has said the country should be restructured and they would go their ways. Are you in support of this?
We welcome restructuring of Nigeria and we believe that will be a permanent solution to this crisis and some other problems. If Miyetti Allah is saying Fulani should go their way, it is will be good riddance to bad rubbish.  We are hospitable in Yorubaland and it will surprise you that there are some Fulani that are still living with us in this town despite the Friday crisis. They move about without fear because those ones are not our problem but the Seriki and his followers.

No fewer than 10 persons have been reportedly killed and 25 others abducted by suspected herdsmen in the Ibarapa area of Oyo State within two years.
The Lanlate Renaissance Group, who made this known in a press statement obtained by our correspondent on Sunday, lamented that many farmers had abandoned their farms over the kidnapping and killings in the area.
The statement titled, “Insecurity in Ibarapa land, Nature Abhors Vacuum: Sunday Igboho remains our hero’, was a reaction to moves by the  Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, to evict Fulani from the area.
 
[READ ALSO] Ibarapaland: Oyo community laments ordeals at the hands of killer herdsmen
The group’s Secretary, Abimbola Adeyeri, alleged that Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde; and members of the state’s House of Assembly had refused to take the matter up.
Part of the statement read, “The Fulanis have not been without pains, sorrows, and tears over the years. The people in Ibarapa are helpless, restless, and despondent over the activities of some unscrupulous herdsmen and criminal gangs that have been kidnapping, killing, and extorting money from helpless citizens through ransom payments. They invade our farms, rape our young ladies and women, destroy our properties, and recently became bandits and terrorists in our midst.

“For many years, farm plundering was the full-time business of the Fulani herders, growing audaciously in bounds even as their highest authorities and agents of government ensured no Fulani was prosecuted for offences they were caught committing. When they are caught in the dastardly acts, they will result in violent attacks with machetes and guns.
“Every arrest would be truncated by their Seriki, and the bulk of the world felt the gory episodes ravaging Ibarapa land was just a series of exaggerated tragedies meant only to discredit the perpetrators.
“For the purpose of records, we shall elucidate on some of the prominent killings by these people in our domain that have gone unabated with an astronomical spike in the last 24 months resulting in about 10 deaths and over 25 abductions.
“Each of the towns in Ibarapa has had a fair share of these dastard acts of these blood-thirsty herders. In September 2019, four staff of Oyo state College of Agriculture and Technology, Igboora were kidnapped and were later released after payment of ransom.

“Also, on the 10th of July, 2020, Ms Modupe Oyetoso and her fiancé were returning from their farm in Igbodudu, Lanlate around 5 pm when bloodthirsty herders accosted these young agropreneurs killing Modupe’s fiancé and whisked Modupe away for two days.
“She spent two days with her abductors and only secured her release after an undisclosed sum of money was paid as ransom to the kidnappers. Modupe confirmed her abductors were Fulani.
“Today, Ms Modupe Oyetoso has abandoned her over 5,000 hectares of farm due to the trauma she passed through.
“Barely two weeks after Modupe’s case, a Cocoa farmer and merchant, Alhaji Fatai Ogunniyi also known as ‘Fatai Cocoa’ was kidnapped on the Maya axis of Lanlate. He was later released two days after a huge ransom was paid. He confirmed that he was kidnapped by Fulani herders
“On the 12th of December, 2020, Dr Fatai Aborode, a prominent son of Igangan and a University of Glasgow, Aberdeen trained Chemist was murdered in cold blood on his farm by Fulani herdsmen.
“He has established hundreds of hectares of farmlands employing youths from his hometown Igangan and other sister communities of Ibarapa and beyond. No government statement or positive action to track his killers.
“It must be put on record that, since the hacking to death of Dr Aborode in Igangan in December 2020 no day has passed without the herders attacking, kidnapping, or even killing innocent Ibarapa indigenes.      
“On the 2nd of January, 2021, Mrs Sherifat Adisa, the owner of Subawah Petroleum, and two other persons were shot dead by Fulani in Idere, another town in Ibarapa.”
He berated Makinde and the Inspector General of Police, Adamu Mohammed, for ordering Igboho’s arrest.
“Reports on the directive of the Governor and the Inspector General of Police to arrest Chief Sunday Adeyemo then rubbed salt on our injury as a people. Issuing tough orders will exacerbate an already charged situation. Makinde should use tact and “native intelligence” to handle this tense situation.
“Blame these irresponsible Governments and not Igboho who only filled a vacuum. Nature detests vacuum. Only in Nigeria would Fulani herdsmen rape, maim and kill mercilessly in their raid of farms and towns, and the IGP wouldn’t order the arrest of any,” the statement added."

This came just as the Oyo State Government said that a delegation including the Commissioner of Police in the state, Ngozi Onadeko, would conduct an on-the-spot assessment of Igangan community.

The monarch, who spoke in an interview with our correspondent on Saturday, said, “The people of Igangan rose against the incursion of killer herdsmen in our community considering our experiences over the years. It has been incidents of killing, maiming, kidnapping for money and raping. It has got to an unbearable level so we asked that they should excuse us.
“As we speak, the three Kara cattle markets in my domain have been shut down. Majority of them engage in illicit acts. Strangers infiltrated our midst to kidnap our people for money. They raped our women and also destroyed our farmlands with cattle. We have asked the herdsmen to leave our midst because they don’t have an iota of respect for human lives. They killed our people, they stole and drove our farmers from the farm.”      
On the visit of Sunday Igboho to Igangan on Friday, the monarch said, “Sunday Igboho and his men came to the town. The youths welcomed them and he addressed them using words of assurance but he never caused trouble and did not attack anybody. I did not know or hear of it (destruction of Seriki Fulani’s property) until Saturday morning. We can’t tell the particular person who did it.

“As of now (Saturday), I have not got the details of how it happened but I can tell you that it was not Igboho and his people because there was no such incident during his visit. We implore the government and the security agents to come to our aid. We cannot secure ourselves against the bandits, so we call for tighter security of our community. We should not be abandoned to our fate. The killer herders are out of control. Rather than seek Igboho’s arrest they should dialogue to know what went wrong, what my people are facing and consider possible solutions.”
Meanwhile, the Chief Press Secretary to the Oyo State Governor,  Mr Taiwo Adisa, said the new CP, Ngozi Onadeko, would lead the police delegation.

Adisa said, “They are to engage youths and calm frayed nerves. It is not clear as of press time who will lead the government team, but sources said that Governor Seyi Makinde has constituted a high powered delegation among his senior officials to embark on this trip. A full report of the Ibarapa situation will be made public by the government and the police after the assessment tour. Sources said that the team on the government side has been mandated to dissuade the stakeholders from unduly politicising the situation at hand or fuelling ethnic tension.”

Gunmen suspected to be bandits early Friday morning abducted the village head of Raddah community in the Charanchi Local Government Area of Katsina State, Alhaji Kabir Umar.
They also injured Umar’s younger brother identified as Aminu, who is currently receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in Katsina.
Residents told one of our correspondents that the gunmen stormed the community in large numbers around 2am and operated for hours.
 
One of them, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “They abducted our village head and wounded his younger brother on the thigh. They kept on shooting during the operation.”
 The source added that the whereabouts of the village head were still unknown.
The spokesman for the Katsina Police Command, SP Gambo Isah, confirmed the incident but did not give details. “It is true,” he said briefly on the phone.      
 Also, gunmen on Thursday night kidnapped Chairman of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities, Delta State University, Mr Monday Izu.
Sources said that the whereabouts of the labour leader could not be ascertained as of noon on Friday as the kidnappers had yet to establish contact with the family members of the victim.
The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the abduction, adding that efforts were ongoing to rescue Izu unhurt and apprehend the abductors. His abduction occurred just 11 days after his 63rd birthday as obtained from his Facebook account.
Meanwhile, four suspected kidnappers were feared killed when men of the Nigerian Army attacked them along Owo-Ifon Expressway, Ondo State on Friday.
The soldiers said to be on patrol along the expressway reportedly ran into the kidnappers who barricaded the road in an attempt to abduct some travellers.
It was gathered that the hoodlums had already kidnapped some victims when the soldiers got to the spot.  Related News   
A source said, “On sighting the soldiers, the hoodlums opened fire on them and the soldiers responded and killed four of the hoodlums while four of the soldiers were also wounded.        
“The gun duel lasted for almost an hour but the kidnappers left the victims and ran into the forest while the injured soldiers were taken to the Federal Medical Centre, Owo.”
The police spokesperson in the state, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, who confirmed the incident, said policemen were in the forest searching for the bandits.
The spokesman for the 32 Artillery Brigade, of the Nigerian Army, Captain Ayorinde Omojokun, promised to call back our correspondent but had yet to do so as of the time of filing this report.
In a related development, residents of Owobamigbe Farm Settlement, in the Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State, have reportedly fled the community for fear of being attacked by the Fulani herdsmen.
It was gathered that fight broke out between a cassava farmer and herdsmen in the community as it was alleged that the herdsmen used their cows to destroy large expanse of cassava farms located at the area.
A source said the fight broke out on Friday morning when the son of the farmer met some herders on the farm uprooting cassava to feed their cows.
His attempt to stop them made the herdsmen to allegedly attack him with machetes, inflicting injuries on him. The source said it was the other farmers who rescued the victim.      
A resident of the community, Mr Michael Abiodun, explained that the villagers had started leaving the area for fear of further attacks by the herdsmen.
Abiodun said, “We are not going to sleep in our hamlets for now because anytime we have issues with herdsmen, they would always return at night to attack us.” He urged the police and Amotekun corps in the state to come to their rescue and beef up security in the area to prevent bloodshed.

7th January 2021,"It’s lazy for military to say  Boko Haram has been degraded when villages are  burnt, people are killed and kidnapped daily – Chibok community leader, Allen","Will you say the security situation is improving in the North-East?
 The security situation is bad and it’s getting worse because the attacks are on the rise and casualties are on the rise;majority of the attacks are not even reported and people are getting abducted. It calls for concern because nobody is safe, nobody knows what is happening. There is no way out for those abducted. Officials give foodstuffs and stipends to those that have been affected; it’s a circle and nothing is changing.
But the military said they have degraded the insurgents, while the Presidency insisted that the security situation has improved compared to before. Are these not so?
 It is an assessment of a lazy person to compare wrong with another wrong or failure with another failure. Because bombs are not exploding inside Maiduguri like before does not mean that the situation has improved to the level we want. This is a war that has been ongoing for over 10 years and this government has been in power for six years. If they were able to stop bombings inside Maiduguri and people are still getting abducted on the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway as it has been over the years, then nothing has reduced.
 
The total number of people abducted between Maiduguri and Damaturu far outnumbers the people that have been killed by all the blasts that had taken place. So, what are they saying? Every day, attacks are going on in communities, people are getting abducted, houses are being razed. So, what exactly are they saying that things are improving? So, because bombs are not raining down on Maiduguri, is that a yardstick for measuring progress in prosecuting the war on terror?
What will you say the military is not doing right?
 It’s a complete absence of governance; the sincerity of purpose and leadership and the absence of willpower on the part of the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, Federal Republic of Nigeria, who happens to be Muhammadu Buhari. He is completely not aware of what is happening in this country and whatever he is being fed, if that is the best he thinks the service chiefs can provide, that does not come close to good governance.      
Good governance means the best and the most important thing constitutionally and for a President to ensure the security of lives and property of the citizens. That is not being done as far as Nigeria is concerned. For him to say he has a team that is giving him the best is the greatest insult we are getting as citizens and as the electorates in a democratic country. That is unacceptable and we cannot keep quiet because it is far below what we were expecting. Every day, blood is being spilled and people are running helter-skelter to raise ransom and more people are being abducted and killed daily and you say that is the best you can offer? It is not right.
Why do you think the President is still retaining the service chiefs despite their perceived failings?
 The only person that is satisfied with the performance of the service chiefs is President Buhari and I don’t think there is any other person except someone that is completely dependent on his government and they have no choice than to support him. Last week, the former governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, said Buhari is not God and must be criticised and that he should allow the service chiefs to go. How many years have these people been in office? There are lots of young officers; these service chiefs don’t have the monopoly of knowledge or the command and control structure of the military. They have put in over 40 years; they should allow others to take over.
Mr President is the only one that is seeing what they are doing; for us, they are not doing anything and we want them to go. New officers taking over must come on board with deliverables and timelines; that is what we want, not providing excuses for mediocrity and failure. The President’s confidence in the service chiefs is not acceptable, justifiable and it is an insult to our collective sensibilities. People are dying daily and being kidnapped and you are saying this is the best you can offer the country in six years of your presidency.
Why has the increased number of troops not deterred the attacks on Chibok communities?
 It is because the super camp policy of the Army came into existence and troops are scattered and there are swathes of land that have been left open for insurgents to crisscross and move at will. So, nobody is monitoring the bushes, the routes of the terrorists and so they move freely, attack villages and ransack them.
As I speak to you now, the terrorists are attacking one of the largest towns in Askira Uba, which is Wumbi. It is a big town and you can’t begin to think that such a town can be attacked with the number of security personnel there. What are we saying? If there are soldiers in Chibok and some other villages, that doesn’t mean we have adequate soldiers to man the over 50 or 60 villages scattered all over the Chibok Local Government Area. There are places, towns and villages that you cannot find one security officer.        
You may get a few vigilante members keeping watch and most of them cannot withstand the superior firepower of the Boko Haram insurgents. The most they can do is to alert the people to run away or inform the military. So, the communities are getting attacked consistently. Just between December 24 and today (January 5), two villages have been attacked with many people killed and others abducted. Nothing is changing.  Related News   Nigeria drops in global military ranking, DHQ mum  Coup: DSS confirms Fani-Kayode invitation  CBN policy may frustrate military operations - NSA   
But the Defence Headquarters blamed the local communities for allegedly collaborating with the insurgents. Do you agree with this?
 This is the type of lazy statements I’m talking about. If at all the local communities are not cooperating, by now, the intelligence community should have landed a lot of undercover intelligence operatives to make use of the available crude intelligence flowing on the streets of the villages and towns, even in the internally displaced persons’ camps. There are lots of things going on. People have been communicating with the military. The entire population of the North-East and even those outside the region are tired of this senseless war and they want security to improve. So, nobody will hide anything from the military.
That notwithstanding, we are not saying the insurgents do not have informants and their members embedded in the communities. That is why we have been calling for improved intelligence gathering and sharing. What have they been doing? Are they waiting for us? Some of the towns are at the mercy of the insurgents. So, the people should do what exactly? On Sunday, they reported that the insurgents were gathering in Damboa. What did the security agencies do with that intelligence? It was even posted on Twitter; they did nothing until Kuda in Chibok was attacked.
Five hours before the attack on Chibok (in 2014), intelligence was provided to them; the governor at that time was informed. That would tell you everybody that mattered in the security and intelligence system was aware that the insurgents were planning an attack on Chibok. The attack still happened; the insurgents abducted the girls the following day; nothing has happened seven years down the line. What happened in Zarbamari where they beheaded farmers? The Presidency claimed that the farmers did not have a permit to go to their farms. You were watching them planting, harvesting and then you said they didn’t have the permit to farm. Do they have any other job? Why wouldn’t they provide security for those people? Those people countered everything the military said. We are not disputing the fact that there are people in the communities, who are sympathetic to the terrorists.
Why is it difficult to apprehend Boko Haram collaborators in the communities? Are they being shielded by the people?
 But that is the job of the intelligence community to dig out. It is not the job of the majority of the poor, unschooled residents, who are trying to survive. The job of the state is to protect those people and ensure that all threats are identified and removed. Boko Haram insurgents don’t come in the evening again; the attacks happening between Maiduguri and Damaturu always occur in broad daylight.      
What happened to our fighter jets and the helicopters they have been buying? What happened to the troops at the many checkpoints on the road? Can’t they pursue and overtake the insurgents and recover all? Why will they stay in one place and keep protecting themselves leaving the people at the mercy of the insurgents? Why are they hiding in the super camps and leaving the vast majority of the community in swathes of land in deserts vulnerable to Boko Haram attacks?
With 20, 30 trucks, every day they attack villages, pack foodstuffs and drive on the open road and yet, we have air surveillance aircraft. Security forces are there but they cannot go after them. There is no excuse. It is in this country that a few American troops came and rescued an abducted American citizen and went back safely. And we are here providing excuses for failure and mediocrity; giving excuses that it is an unconventional war, it is guerrilla warfare. Is guerrilla warfare starting with us? How many are the Boko Haram terrorists we are talking about? Are we saying as the giant of Africa, we cannot assemble enough security personnel to exterminate these people?
The Multinational Joint Task Force is doing well but Nigerians are always clamouring to be the commander. Why can’t a Nigerien, Chadian or Cameroonian head it and then, we see the changes? Attacks on military bases are far more under this government than under the previous administration we were critical of.
What strategies will you recommend to end the insurgency?
 We completely don’t have leadership in Nigeria and the willpower is not there. If at all it is there, another large-scale abduction like that of the Chibok schoolgirls wouldn’t have happened again. Chibok happened, Dapchi happened and Kankara school abduction happened and many others. If at all there is political will, these won’t have happened. If they are ready to end this crisis, they will know how to equip the military, recruit more men and ensure that the intelligence gathering and sharing and the partnership with the neighbouring countries are put in place. If we don’t have capacity; this is the 21st century, capacity is available on the global platform for sale. Nigeria can buy capacity from anywhere; if we want foreign boots on our soil, let them come. Support whatever logistics and countries that are ready to support us, regardless of whatever conditions that are attached. You can only be the President when there is Nigeria. The call is to the President to know what to do, but they know what to do, they don’t want to do it. If it’s mercenaries, let them come.

2nd January 2021,"How we kidnapped many, killed abducted cop after N1m ransom payment –Suspects","Afeez Hanafi
Some suspected kidnappers operating in Rivers State have recounted how they perpetrated crime in several locations of the state and collected ransoms running into millions of naira.
The suspects were arrested recently by operatives of the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team after the kidnapping and killing of a Divisional Crime Officer of the Afam Police Station in Rivers State, SP Moses Egbede.
They are Isaac Aforji aka Angel Boy, Philemon Barifa, Emmanuel Okechukwu alias Ezeruwa, Emeka Chukwuma, Prince Zopkara, Onyemechi Francis, a driver; Lucky Teeage, a priest; Pius Kpala, Barriston Gbara, and a youth leader, Lemon Kenneth.
 
It was learnt that Egbede was driving to the office in his Lexus 300 Sport Utility Vehicle on the morning of July 21, 2020 when five armed men ambushed him along Obiama Pipeline Road and took him to their camp in Agbeta in the Eleme Local Government Area of the state.
They were said to have contacted his wife, Grace, two days later and demanded N50m ransom which was later reduced to N1m.
City Round gathered that On July 31, his son, Emmanuel, took the money to the kidnappers on Ogale Pipeline Road.      
They promised to release the officer consequently but killed him two days after and dumped his corpse in a well on the orders of Aforji, who claimed that Egbede once detained his wife.
In an interview with City Round earlier in the week, 34-year-old Aforji, opened up on his criminal escapades ranging from illegal oil bunkering to series of kidnappings.
He said, “I am married with three children. I am from Eleme, Rivers State and attended only primary school. I learned welding for two years and later opened a welding workshop. There was a crisis in my community and my equipment was stolen. I then started to ride motorbikes.

“I got married and ventured into oil bunkering business. I had a fire accident and sustained burns. I spent all the money I had for my treatment. I was broke and met a youth leader known as Tombare. I told him about my issue and he got me involved in kidnapping.
“In the first kidnapping, we collected N200,000 ransom. The second operation was a woman and her child. We were paid N300,000 as ransom and I got N30,000. We also kidnapped one Okechukwu and collected N1m ransom before we released him. I got N100,000 as my share.
“In May 2020, we kidnapped a man known as Lotto man and took him to our camp. I don’t know the amount collected as ransom but I was given N80,000.”        
He said during the operation, someone identified him and reported him to the police.
Aforji stated that policemen reportedly led by the late DCO stormed his house and arrested his wife when they did not meet him.
He added, “When I didn’t show up, she was later released. I was told that the DCO Afam Police Station and one Inspector Christ were part of the police team.

“Then we kidnapped the policeman (Egbede). His cousin, one Friday, brought the job. He spent some days with us and N1m ransom was paid. I then insisted that he must be killed because he embarrassed me before my wife.
“Teddy (a gang member at large) shot him dead and his body was dumped inside a well. Teddy took away his Lexus vehicle.”
In his account, Barifa, 23, said he used to be a farmer before he went into kidnapping in 2016 after cattle reared by one Alhaji Abdullahi reportedly destroyed his crops.
He said they kidnapped Abdullahi and collected N3m ransom out of which he was given N380,000, adding that they subsequently killed and buried the man.      
“We were seven that kidnapped him. We all contributed N180,000 and gave it to our chief priest (Teeage),” he said.
The father of one explained that he relocated from Eleme after Abdullahi’s murder in 2017 and returned last year to form a new gang together with Aforji and four other friends.
He also admitted to have participated in the policeman’s kidnap and killing, adding that the gang operated with four locally-made guns.
He stated, “I got N200,000 as my share of the N1m ransom. Then, we kidnapped a man in a Toyota Highlander and blinded one of his eyes. The man managed to escape from our camp when we took his car to Port Harcourt for sale. I was arrested two days after that operation.”

Okechukwu, 34, who said his role was to get food for victims held in their camp, disclosed that he got N15,000 from the ransom paid for the policeman.
Chukwuma, 22, said, “I am from Abia State but reside in Obigbo. I was part of the group that monitored the policeman in the camp after and was given N30,000 as my share.”  
Zopkara, who rented out an AK-47 rifle to the gang, said he got a share of between N80,000 and N100,000 after each operation.
Teeage said he participated in the kidnapping of Abdullahi, adding that he did not know about his murder. Besides, 28-year-old Gbara, a hunter, confessed to selling bullets to the gang for N4,000.
On his role in Abdullahi’s abduction, Kenneth said, “I was given the N3m ransom by the family and every member got N380,000.”

12th December 2020,"Terrorists kidnap groom, best man in Borno —Report","Terrorists have kidnapped two aid workers in Nigeria’s restive northeast Borno State as they were returning from a wedding, humanitarian and security sources said Saturday.
The two were identified as an employee of UN World Food Programme, who had just attended his wedding, and a colleague from the International Committee of the Red Cross who had been the best man at the ceremony.
They were seized by Islamic State West Africa Province on Wednesday near Jakana village, the sources said.
“ISWAP terrorists took the two aid workers hostage at a checkpoint they mounted near Jakana,” a UN source told AFP.
 
The hostages were returning to the regional capital Maiduguri from the wedding in neighbouring Adamawa State when they were stopped at a bogus checkpoint around 1230 GMT, the source said.
The WFP worker “had his wedding on November 28 and the Red Cross colleague was his best man,” said the UN source.
A military source in Jakana confirmed the kidnap of “two humanitarian staff by ISWAP terrorists.”      
On Wednesday, the UN issued a memo informing its staff about the abduction of a “UN national staff embarking on a private trip… by NSAG (non-state armed group)”.
The memo did not state which UN agency the kidnapped staffer worked for.  Related News   IPOB, Amotekun may spark post-election violence - US institutes  IPOB, terrorists threat to 2023 polls –Report  Airstrike kills ISWAP commander in Lake Chad region

The incident happened along the 120-kilometre Maiduguri/Damaturu highway which passes through Jakana, said the memo seen by AFP.
In a statement on Friday, ISWAP said it seized “two Christians working for the Red Cross organisation”.
The group said the incident occurred at a checkpoint between the village of Mainok and Maiduguri.
Jakana, 25 kilometres from Maiduguri, lies on a known crossing route for ISWAP fighters moving between their camps in the Benisheikh forest area of Borno and their hideouts in the Buni Yadi area of Yobe state.        
Since it split from mainstream Boko Haram group in 2016, ISWAP has intensified attacks on military targets but it has increasingly been targeting civilians.
Thousands of people have been killed and around two million displaced in the Islamist conflict which started 11 years ago in Nigeria’s northeast.
The violence has spread to neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Chad, leading to the formation of a regional military force to fight the insurgents.

6th December 2020,"Nigerians paying more for food, others as we’re  being killed, kidnapped – Farmers","Tope Omogbolagun
If Modupe Oyetoso had known that her fiancé would be targeted and killed on his farm, she would not have introduced him to farming. Now, all she knows are regret, guilt, sadness, fear and shock all mingled together.
On the day Modupe’s world came tumbling down, she and her fiancé had just left their farm at Lanlate, located between Iseyin and Eruwa in Oyo State after a particularly tough day when they were attacked by bandits. That was the beginning of Modupe’s nightmare. It is an experience she dreads to recount because of the emotional trauma that always accompanies it.
But she has been told of how unhealthy it is to bottle up her anger and frustration, so she has concluded that talking about it, though painful, might just be the one thing that would cure her of her recent desire for self-abuse, which has sometimes been suicidal.
 
“It was unexpected as it happened around 5pm. Four bandits waylaid us and as my fiancé was trying to manoeuvre to find a way to escape, one of the gunmen shot him,” she said, recalling the tragic experience of that evening.
“The bullet hit my fiancé in the head – it went in through the back of his head. I didn’t know what to do, as blood was gushing out of his head. I thought I could save him by applying pressure on it to stop the blood from coming out, but I couldn’t do it because the car was still in motion, and it almost hit a tree.”
After she managed to stop the vehicle, the assailants caught up with her and whisked her off into a nearby forest. They abandoned her fiancé and left him to die, despite her desperate cries that he needed help.      
Modupe recalled that the bandits didn’t only kill her fiancé, they also dehumanised her.
“In the forest, the bandits tied my hands and one of them was pulling me with the rope, while another one was hitting me from the back to get me to move faster so they could escape. When I slumped onto the ground, they beat me and pulled me up. I had to summon the strength to run along with them as it was raining.”
After brutalising their victim, the bandits demanded a ransom of N50m to release her.
“When we got to a place, they brought out my fiancé’s phone, removed his SIM card, inserted it into another phone and asked me to call my parents to inform them that they wanted N50m before they would release me,” she said.
“My dad started pleading with them and they told him that if he wanted to see me alive, he should get the money. They spoke with him in Yoruba, but communicated with each other in another language.
“We have a lot of Fulani settlers where our farm is located so I could tell that those people were Fulani. They were dressed like them. They told me they didn’t have any cattle and that kidnapping was the only thing they did for money.”
Many farmers have been killed, maimed, kidnapped and injured over the years. They are kidnapped and, in some cases, killed on their farms. According to the farmers who spoke to our correspondent, this unfortunate situation has no doubt affected planting and contributed to the recent increase in the prices of food items.        
For instance, Boko Haram terrorists reportedly killed at least 43 farm workers and injured six in rice fields in Koshebe, a place in the Mafa Local Government Area of Borno State last Saturday. An anti-jihadist militia told AFP that the assailants tied up the farmer and slit their throats in the village. Also, a member of the state Civilian Joint Task Force, Babakura Kolo, who assisted some of the survivors, put the number of people killed at 43, but the United Nations later said 110 rice farmers lost their lives during the attack.
A factional leader of the Boko Haram insurgents, Abubakar Shekau, who confirmed that his group was responsible for the killing, in a three-minute video released on Tuesday, said his group killed 78 farmers because “the farmers arrested and handed one of its brothers to the Nigerian Army”.
Safety of life over crops
Farmers have always been protective of their crops as they are the fruits of their hard work, which are expected to bring in income or at the very least, feed them and their families.  The recent events mean farmers now have to choose between saving themselves or their crops in the absence of security guarantee against incessant threats.
A farmer in Niger State, Grace Disa, noted how insecurity has affected food production in the state, particularly in four local government areas.
“Just last week (recently), two farmers were killed and 23 others were kidnapped. It is a battle faced by both male and female farmers,” Disa said.
She identified the crops predominantly cultivated in the area as including rice, beans, soybeans, guinea corn, and yam.      
“Lockdown (occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic) really affected farmers so if you add insecurity to that, you get the reason for the shortage of foodstuffs and increase in food prices. We have not been able to go to the farm, even to harvest,” she added.
“We are all scared – both men and women. Since kidnappings and bandit attacks became common, many farmers have stopped going to their farms and because they aren’t going there, thieves steal from the farms. This automatically affects harvests and then reflects in the prices of goods and commodities. It eventually led to food shortage.
“We have to choose between our lives and our crops and many of us have chosen our lives because they are worth more than food.”
Another farmer, Mrs Mosun Umoru, identified insecurity, challenges with forex, and COVID-19 as responsible for the recent increase in food prices.
She said, “Currently in the country, there is instability. Also, it costs a lot to get forex. We know how COVID-19 also hit the world. And before that, we were battling with insecurity, access to input, and climate change.
“The problem of insecurity is still there. The safety of farmers on the farm is not guaranteed. Right now, the challenge is that herders come into our farms to graze their cattle and this is affecting our operations and output. Farmers are being kidnapped anyhow so we are not able to cultivate.”
Umoru added that because of bad roads and traffic congestion, farmers get to their farms late and then have to leave early because it’s unsafe to stay late in the farm.  
“So farmers aren’t even able to do much on the farm because of these problems, which no doubt would affect food production,” she said.
“Insecurity is a big challenge for me. I can’t afford to keep paying mobile police to escort me to the farm. You want to stay on the farm to work, but you don’t feel safe.”
Speaking on the increase in the prices of poultry and livestock and the projected further increase in food prices in December, the Chief Executive Officer of Farm Shoppe identified climate change as one of the contributory factors.
 Umoru added, “In some places, farmers don’t have irrigation and the rains didn’t start on time. Basically, we were not prepared for the challenges we faced. The inconsistencies in rainfall this year also affected farmers. Only people who had irrigation could do well.
“The recent increase in fuel prices also negatively affected cost of production and the livelihoods of farmers and their association.”
The multi-agro farmer said the scarcity of raw materials such as maize also contributed to the problem as the poultry industry depends largely on maize.
She added, “Fifty per cent or 70 per cent of our food substitute is largely dependent on maize. So, if the country could not produce enough maize and depended on some countries that shut their borders on account of COVID-19 for about six months, then there was no way food prices would not go up.      
“There are so many issues and the scarcity or high cost of maize is a major issue. We have been doing a lot of reviews for our retail prices. We import some of the feed that we use and because we went into lockdown for months, many people couldn’t get feed for production.
“Also regarding COVID-19, we didn’t have sufficient manpower for our operations because we had to put safety over income.”
Like other farmers, Jumoke Abikoye, said insecurity affected the production of food, which in turn led to increase in food prices.
She said, “Going to the farm has been a risky venture due to the recent activities of bandits. What I do is to avoid staying late on the farm. These days, I’m on the field and my heart is in my mouth. I have only been trusting God for safety.
“Quite a number of my fellow farmers have been attacked on the farm; some of them were kidnapped and they had to pay a lot of money before they were released.  Recently, another colleague was kidnapped on Abuja-Kaduna Road. It’s not been easy. Many farmers have abandoned their crops on the farm. They can’t even go to the farm to harvest and if crops aren’t harvested, the farmers will lose and food availability will be affected. We all know that foodstuffs will be scarce if supply does not meet demand.”
In the same vein, a farmer who is the President, Igangan Agro Park Investors Association in Oyo State, Oluwafemi Abioye, lamented the issue of insecurity amongst the many challenges farmers are faced with in the hands of nomadic herders.
He confirmed that many farmers have deserted the farms, leaving their crops to rot because of threats to their lives.        
He said, “My farmers have deserted the farms after they were attacked by herdsmen. Two of my farmers sustained injuries, and they aren’t sure of returning to the farm to work again. If farmers continue to abandon farming activities, how do we produce foodstuffs for the masses?”
Narrating his ordeal, Abioye said farming has been tough as he has been recording losses because of the activities of herdsmen.
He said, “To say our experience has been tough is an understatement. Despite being commercial farmers, we have not enjoyed any government support, financial or infrastructural. And the most important thing to us – security – is absent. I can tell you that the state is not doing so well in terms of this. We have a huge security problem at Agro Park.
“One of the reasons companies and individual farmers applied for land at the park was to feel secure. They felt that since the land belonged to the government, there wouldn’t be issues with ‘omo onile’ (land grabbers), thieves and all that. But we were wrong. At least, we thought if there were any, it would be minimal, but we were completely wrong. Since we moved there, we have been facing one form of insecurity or another.
“We moved here in 2018 and since that time, we have experienced different forms of farm destruction. Herdsmen would come in and destroy our farms. They would bring their cattle and destroy 50 or 60 acres of farmland with crops at a go. It could be cassava or maize. We at the park calculated our losses in June 2020 and realised that we had lost well over N320m to herdsmen since we came here in 2018. We have records; we didn’t pull this out of thin air.
“Between June and September, over 50 acres of maize and cassava have been destroyed. If you calculate that, the losses run into several millions of naira. That is what we suffer for doing agricultural business and we are not getting support or grants from anywhere. We are not even doing it to get grants. We just want a peaceful environment to do our business and we want the government to provide infrastructure. Herdsmen and locals should stop destroying our farms; that is all that we want.
“After destroying about 20 acres of maize farm, the local security men stopped them from further destroying the farm. These herdsmen, fully armed, became angry, but they could not do anything because the local guards were also armed, so they left. But they came back at night when the local security guards had to run for their lives. They destroyed about 10 acres of land with ripe cucumbers and watermelons. They slashed all the watermelons before daybreak.”      
Nigerians groan as good prices go up
Oluseye Savage had given his wife, Yetunde, some money for the family upkeep. As usual, he’d give his wife N20 000 from his salary to get foodstuffs for the house for the month.
Savage, who is a teacher at a private school, hasn’t stabilised financially since the outbreak of COVID-19. According to him, the foodstuffs his wife returned home with some months ago completely shocked him. The N20,000 could not buy a quarter of the foodstuffs she used to buy some months earlier.
He said, “She came back with a few portions of rice, beans, garri and semo. She couldn’t even buy yam. She had to buy small quantities of palm oil and vegetables. If not that I know how honest my wife is, I could have sworn that my wife kept part of the money for herself.”
For Savage, it was a struggle living with his meagre salary even before now. Now, he is distressed by the situation such that he dreads to dare to think about the future.
“I don’t even know what to do because, at this rate, an average man can no longer survive in this country,” he added sharply with anger in his voice.  Related News   
“The foodstuffs she bought finished well before the end of the month. We had to look for other means to survive for the month. I have increased the feeding allowance to N30,000 but the situation still didn’t improve.      
“Beyond the cost of foodstuffs, we still have to deal with the increase in fuel prices and electricity tariff. I must confess that life has been tough and hellish.”
Mrs Bose Fadairo, who trades in foodstuffs and frozen foods, sat in her shop morosely contemplating the future when our correspondent met her. Rising inflation amid tough economic situations has crippled her business. She feared the business might not survive beyond 2020.
“I used to purchase three bags of rice which I would sell to customers. The turnover was good and I was able to soon restock. But now, the story has changed.  The amount of money that used to buy me three bags of rice is what I now use to buy one and a half bags of rice; sometimes, it is even worse than that. Even my frozen foods business has taken a hit,” she said.
“I don’t understand what is happening; it is affecting my business and I can’t even get the money I put into my business out. I can no longer afford the basic things that I need. My husband is a retiree, so my family has had to rely on my business for support, but things are getting really bad now.”
On the streets and on social media, Nigerians have been complaining about the recent hikes in prices of foodstuffs and goods. Onions, which are one of the most popular food items, have been likened to gold because of their high prices. A small onion, not bigger than an egg, is sold for N100.
 Way out of tough situation
 Umoru urged the government to improve security for farmers.      
She said, “The government should also look into subsidising agriculture in Nigeria. We hear about loans for agriculture, but they are almost inaccessible. We don’t have any problem dealing with the cost of farming ourselves but the government must create an enabling environment for us. If I am bringing in seeds, make it easy for me to clear them at the port.
“Power tariff has doubled, fuel prices have gone up, and there are many inconsistencies in the economy.”
Abioye said the government must be sincere and ensure its policies truly encourage farming.
According to him, the government can solve the problem by ensuring that nomadic herders adopt ranching.
The factional President of All Farmers Association of Nigeria, Kabir Ibrahim, identified a number of factors as being responsible for the increase in food prices.
He said, “Our production was interfered with by COVID-19, the flooding that we had in some parts of northern Nigeria, especially the areas considered as the food baskets of the country, and insecurity in some areas in the North-West and North-East led to problems. Generally, we can say that the insufficiency sprouted from there. I am from a region where onions are produced. We noticed that the price increased.
“So, increase in food prices is not limited to a particular part, it is everywhere. In the Lagos area, because the onions and vegetables are just coming out, prices are very high now. But in a few months, there will be plenty of harvest. Prices might come down a little. But generally speaking, you must look at the economy. The economy necessitates that these things will cost more because the purchasing power of the currency is low.      
 “But generally speaking, many things will come into play and, God forbid that the recession should last for long, we might get into big trouble. There is the tendency that there will be more serious hunger in the country.”
Ibrahim added that the issue of banditry also contributed heavily to the shortage of food and increase in food prices.
He added, “I come from the southern part of Kaduna State, the border between Kaduna and Zamfara states, and that is the epicentre of banditry. You couldn’t go to your farm one kilometre outside my local government headquarters. Even now, those people who are able to farm cannot harvest their crops. Farmers are not immune to banditry, kidnapping and other crimes. The farms are in the bush, so it is very difficult for people (farmers) to operate.”
The farmer added that the issue has contributed heavily to the scarcity and non-availability of farm produce.
Inflation caused by disruption in food prices – Economist
An economist, Opeyemi  Agbaje, said there are multiple causes of inflation. Once there are supply gaps for anything, and if for instance, there are supply gaps for food, there will be a lot of disruptions to food production, he said.
He added, “Some of these disruptions can be caused by banditry, conflicts, crime and so on. There are also economic factors, and we know that a lot of things have happened this year.  The supply chain has been disrupted as some companies have shut down. Demand has fallen for various reasons. There are supply gaps.”      
Agbaje also identified challenges with forex issues as a major cause of inflation in Nigeria.
“A lot of the things we use, eat and consume are imported, in terms of their raw materials or as finished goods. There is a significant cost increase due to a lot of things that have happened to the exchange rate,” he said.
The economist said since the unemployment rate has also gone up due to recession, purchasing power has drastically reduced while the cost of living has significantly gone up.
He added, “Now, we are officially in a recession, which means higher unemployment rate and higher poverty level. Those are some of the reasons why people are crying out louder.  In my view, the recession may not go on for more than two quarters; the performance of the economy, even though in recession, could have been worse.
 “The recession itself is not the problem; the bigger problem, however, is when we project that we will continue to have as we had in 2015, a period of low growth. Recession and low growth are similar in their impact, especially in a country where you have poverty and high level of unemployment.”
He explained that the country was in a recession in 2015/16 but when it came out in 2016/17, it never experienced a growth of above two per cent.
“For me, the problem is that we may come out of recession because oil prices may recover, cost of production may return to normal, COVID-19 lockdown, restrictions and all of that may end, but our growth may not surpass two or three per cent, which by Nigerian standard is not good enough. We need a minimum of seven to eight per cent growth for us to recover, create employment, for consumption to go up, and for people to feel optimistic about economic output,” he said.      
“Recessions may persist for two or three quarters, at most four quarters, but the bigger problem is that low growth may continue. As for inflation, it will be difficult to control, until this rapid disruption in forex situation is brought under control and the disruptions to agricultural production, a chain of production and others, are brought under control.  You cannot determine that; it depends on the policies.”
As his recommendation, Agbaje said the government should reform the economy and stimulate investments.
He added, “We should continue on the path of economic reforms, and the key elements of reforms that we need now are reforms to stimulate investment. We need to stimulate local investments by local investors, MSMEs, small businesses, and critically also, foreign investments. We need a significant level of investments in agriculture, infrastructure, economy, private sector, industry, and new investment by both local and foreign investors. That is the only way to stimulate the level of economic activities that will compensate for the loss of production.”
In the same vein, another economist, Ayo Teriba, described the cause of the inflation as being in two parts; one being the recent devaluation, which is best measured by the premium between the bureau de change exchange rate and interbank exchange rate.  According to him, the bureau de change exchange rate reflects the reality that the man on the street is facing. In contrast, the interbank exchange rate is the alternate reality that the Central Bank of Nigeria is trying to give.
He said, “The gap between them is the measure of the extent to which the CBN is paying to meet the demand.  The distance between BDC rate and the interbank rate is the removal of the Central Bank’s premium to ensure adequate forex supply; the wider that distance, the bigger the inflation because they are artificially keeping the interbank rate at where they want, but the BDC is devaluing it. The devaluation that they have allowed in the interbank rate reflects the devaluation that has occurred, so the BDC rate reflects the actual devaluation better.”
Teriba explained that whenever there is devaluation, it affects domestic prices. You don’t have to import the goods you have to sell, he said.
He explained, “We have experienced it before; this is not the first time naira will be going towards N500.  The last time we experienced it in 2016 or January 2017, it went down from above N500 and then came back to N360. When it went above N500, inflation jumped, but when it went below N360, inflation declined for over 10 months. Cost-push inflation arising from devaluation is the immediate cause of the increase in prices that you are seeing.      
“The second reason is the seasonal buying. This is November and people are beginning to stock up for December.  Seasonal buying means that the rate at which people are trying to buy the goods is higher than the rate at which the goods are available.
“This is a year in which the world has suffered lockdown. And the lockdown might have also contributed to the recession because the trading chain seems to have been broken.
“Right now, Nigeria is out of lockdown, but Europe and America are still under lockdown. Stocks are not arriving at the same speed at which they did last year.  There is reduced supply because some of the countries that we import from are in lockdown.”
He said there had been growing demand because of the festive season, and that there had also been a shortage because of lockdown and devaluation.
According to him, the combination is something we have likely not experienced before.
Teriba said the solution is to reverse the devaluation.
“When you reverse the devaluation, the prices of goods will come down.  You can’t stop people from stocking up for Christmas. So, when they finish stocking up for Christmas, in the New Year, inflation will drop.  There is nothing you can do that will prevent the seasonal demand in the festive period from causing inflation. Inflation picks up in November, December and in January, it drops.      
“It is not the fault of Nigeria that Europe and America are in lockdown. There is nothing we can do about it. Anything the government can do to reverse the devaluation will reduce the reactionary pressure.
“There is a lockdown in China, America and Europe. This has made oil prices and the stock market to collapse, so if this shortage is because of the lockdown in some parts of Europe and America, then it calls for the government to give some palliatives to the most vulnerable people even if it is cash so that they can afford items even at higher prices.”
Security tips from experts
A security expert, Mr Pedro Ayandokun, said the banditry affecting farmers and other Nigerians persisted because nothing had been done about it.
He said, “The Federal Government has done nothing to stop the killings by herdsmen, especially in the South-West. Governors should set up state security services like the Western Nigeria Security Network codenamed Operation Amotekun.
“Amotekun should start fully and protect farmers and farmland in the South-West. It’s time for the governors to protect land in their states.”
Another security expert, John Enwelike, said farmers should carefully vet the people they employ as labourers.      
He said, “For instance, regarding the killing of Borno farmers recently, I read that some of those labourers went from as far as Kebbi State to farm in Borno. Farmers should scrutinise the people they want to employ as casual workers on their farms. It seems they don’t take these things seriously.
“Also, they should not always sleep at night when they are on the farm. They should walk around and see what’s happening there, which we call surveillance and intelligence. It is a very important security tip.  And this is not just for farmers; it’s a security tip we must all employ.”

4th December 2020,"Gunmen raid Edo highway, kidnap passengers, kill vigilante","Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin 
Hell was let loose on Thursday as suspected gunmen took over the ever-busy Benin-Ekpoma-Auchi Road in Edo State with some commuters kidnapped in the attack.
A witness told PUNCH Metro that the kidnappers, after seizing a commercial bus, forced the passengers to disembark and led them into a bush.
The driver was reportedly made to block the road with his bus in an attempt to force oncoming vehicles to stop.
 
“What happened was that the gunmen first attacked a commercial bus at the Urhokosa/Obagie end of the road and took a number of passengers into custody.
“The operation was well planned, as the suspected kidnappers divided themselves into groups. A group led the first set of victims into the bush, while a second group forced the driver of the bus to use the vehicle to block the road.
“Other vehicles that ran into the traffic jam caused by the blockade were attacked by another group of the kidnappers, who selected victims and marched them to join the earlier captured passengers in the kidnappers’ den,” the source added.      
A member of a vigilance group in the area was reportedly shot dead when he attempted to disrupt the operation.  Related News   
A motorist, who claimed to have abandoned his vehicle and run into the bush to hide, said he met other people who also escaped into the bush.
He explained that the gunmen shot continuously for a long time without any resistance from security agents.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Chidi Nwabuzor, confirmed the incident.
He said, “Yes, the command is aware of the kidnap, but we have yet to ascertain the number of passengers that were kidnapped.
“A vigilance group in that community engaged the kidnappers and one was killed. Effort is currently ongoing to free those kidnapped. Other information will be revealed as we progress.”

2nd December 2020,"Terrorists kidnap aid worker, two others in Borno —Report","A humanitarian aid worker and two local officials have been abducted by Islamic State West Africa Province fighters in conflict-plagued northeastern Nigeria, two security officials said Wednesday.
They were kidnapped by the jihadists at a checkpoint in the village of Wakilti in Borno State on Monday, the sources told AFP, in the latest incident in a region that has been in the grip of an Islamist insurgency for more than a decade.
“The hostages included two local officials and an aid worker but it is not clear which organisation he works for,” one of the security sources said.
The two officials were returning to the regional capital Maiduguri from the town of Mobbar, where they had gone for local elections held on the weekend, the second source said.
 
In June five humanitarian workers were killed a few days after being abducted by ISWAP, whose stronghold is on the edge of Lake Chad.  Related News   UN condemns execution of four aid workers in Borno  Krimi calls for release of abducted aid workers  Boko Haram allegedly executes aid worker, claims FG deceived them   
The local elections in Borno State were the first held since Boko Haram launched its insurgency in 2009.
In the bloodshed since, more than 36,000 people have been killed and over two million have fled their homes.      
In 2016, Boko Haram splintered into two groups, the Islamic State-affiliated ISWAP and one that remained loyal to historic leader Abubakar Shekau.
The UN said the country’s most violent attack took place on Saturday, when Boko Haram fighters killed 76 farmers in a rice field not far from Maiduguri, slitting the throat of many of the victims.

 Gunmen have kidnapped the wife of Mr Olugbenga Ale, the Chief of Staff to Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu.
This happened while the state was mourning the death of the Olufon of Ifon, Oba Israel Adeusi, who was reportedly killed by some gunmen suspected to be kidnappers at Elegbeka area of Ose Local Government Area of the state on Thursday.
Also, two staff members of Ajaokuta Steel Company Limited, resident on the premises of the steel plant in the Ajaokuta Local Government Area of Kogi State have been abducted by gunmen.
 
It was gathered that Mrs Ale was kidnapped on Thursday night alongside her driver and one other person at Owen area, Idanre, along Ondo-Akure Expressway.
A source, who confirmed the incident to our correspondent said, “I can confirm to you that the wife of the Chief of Staff was kidnapped last night (Thursday) and her whereabouts are not known yet and the kidnappers have not contacted the family.
“I think she was coming from Lagos with a driver and two other people in the car. She was kidnapped along with the driver and one other person. Security men were in the forest last night searching for her.”      
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the incident, saying the command had begun to search for the victims.
He said, “The Commissioner of Police has ordered all the police divisions in the area to go after the hoodlums with the assistance of the military and I hope that very soon we shall have good news from there.”
Meanwhile, Akeredolu has ordered security agencies to fish out the killers of the first-class monarch.

The two workers of Ajaokuta Steel Company Limited kidnapped on Tuesday close to the company staff quarters known as Calabar quarters were simply identified as Austin and Prince.
The incident, according to residents in the area, has since led to apprehension among workers in the steel plant quarters.
It was gathered that the suspected kidnappers initially abducted three workers but released one based on health grounds.        
A family source told our correspondent on Friday that the kidnappers had called in, demanding N1.2m ransom.
“Where will they get such an amount of money in this hard time? The kidnapped victims are just managing to feed themselves and their families. They are just using farming to support their jobs. With the recent development, many residents are now scared of going to their farms.”
The Police Public Relations Officer in Kogi State, William Aya, said the command had not received official information about the incident.
He however promised to get back to our correspondent but had yet to do so as of press time.

22nd November 2020,"Our kidnappers treated us like animals, didn’t feed us for five days –Ondo women market leader kidnapped with 15 others","Where were you coming from when you were kidnapped along the Akure-Owo Expressway? 
I am a trader; I travel to the North to buy goods and I sell in Ondo State. I was coming from Akure where we attended a meeting. Some others and I represented our local government area at the meeting. The people in the team included members of NULGE (Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees), Head of Department, Community Development, Alhaji Mumuni and Mr Akinola.
How were you kidnapped? 
It happened as we were returning from the meeting in Akure. When the bus that conveyed us, which was the local government legislative council vehicle, got to Ogbese town, some of us bought snacks. Less than five minutes after we left Ogbese, that is, between Ogbese and Uso (along Akure-Owo Expressway), some men with guns suddenly stopped us. They were about 10 in number – five in the front and five behind us. They also stopped three other vehicles. They robbed the occupants of those vehicles. Then they asked us to get out of the bus and took us into the bush. The occupants of the other buses were also kidnapped. The kidnappers had Ak47 rifles and they were shooting into the air.
 
How many of you were kidnapped on that day? 
We were many because some travellers going to Lagos and Ibadan were also kidnapped. Our mobile phones and money were taken from us by the bandits. All the money in my bag was taken.
Where were you taken to by the kidnappers?       
We were attacked at exactly 2.30 pm. They led us on a journey inside the forest for several hours at gunpoint. We crossed rivers. It was God that saved me; I could have drowned in one of the rivers. Around 6pm, we met a man and his child and they asked him for direction in the bush. After the man gave them the direction, they also kidnapped him.
What did they say to you at their den? 
They did not say much to us other than to threaten to kill us. They always said they would kill and waste us. The maltreatment got worse when one of us escaped in the night. They were angry that one of us escaped so they started beating us. They tortured us as if we were animals. Whenever they wanted to go somewhere, they would leave four of them behind with guns and sharp cutlasses to make sure we did not escape.  Related News   Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi  Gunmen kidnap Taraba monarch’s wives, son  Woman lures four-year-old to kidnappers, Rivers police arrest suspects   
What were they giving you to eat in those five days?
We were not fed at all; no food, no water in those five days. We saw hell in those days (Those days were a living hell). I had never experienced such maltreatment in my life. As I said, we were treated like animals.
Do you suspect that the bandits knew you would be on the road when they attacked? 
Yes, I suspect that because I discovered that the kidnappers had informants in the towns around there. They usually had telephone conversations. Every time, they were calling their informants who supplied them information about what was going on in the towns in the area.        
At what point did they release you? 
They released us when they were satisfied with the ransom that was paid. Initially, they demanded N100m, but when we could not afford that, they reduced it to N11m, and later to N5m. And I want to use this opportunity to appeal to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to assist me as all the money I was using to trade went into the payment of the ransom. I will also call on the government to provide security for all travellers taking that route.
With your experience, how do you think cases of kidnapping can be reduced in this area?  
I think kidnapping can be reduced in our area if the government can allow farmers to use the land in the area. Government should open up the forest reserve where these criminals hide and perpetrate the crimes. This can be done if the government is really serious about eradicating the menace.

The Rector of the Polytechnic, Kabir Abdullahi, who confirmed the incident to journalists, said the gunmen gained access to the school around 9 pm. 
 
Abdullahi said one of the lecturers was abducted along with two of his children.

4th November 2020,Teachers kidnapped in troubled Cameroon region,"Between six and 11 teachers have been kidnapped from a school in a western Cameroon region gripped by a three-year-old armed campaign by anglophone separatists, local sources said.
The abduction comes on the heels of the killing of seven schoolchildren, which the government has blamed on militants.
The incident happened on Tuesday in Kumbo, in Cameroon’s Northwest Region.
Armed men raided the local Presbyterian primary and secondary school, taking away 11 teachers, said Reverend Samuel Fonki, head of the Presbyterian Church of Cameroon, and Stephen Afuh, head of a presbyterian teachers’ union called PEATTU.

A local official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that six teachers had been kidnapped.
There was no immediate response from the armed forces or government to a request for comment.      
In October 2017, anglophone militants declared an independent state in the Northwest Region and neighboring Southwest Region, home to most of the anglophone minority in the majority French-speaking country.
The declaration, which has not been recognized internationally, sparked a brutal conflict with the security forces.
More than 3,000 people have been killed and more than 700,000 have fled their homes. Rights groups say crimes and abuses have been committed by both sides.
Schools and other institutions deemed to be emblems of the Cameroonian state have been repeatedly targeted for attacks and kidnappings, often for ransom.  Related News   UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Teenager, guardian in court for kidnapping children  Kidnapper caught collecting N3m ransom from victim’s parents   
On October 24, seven children were shot dead in their classroom in Kumba, in the Southwest Region.
In that attack, the government in Yaounde described the armed men as separatists “scaring off parents from sending their children to school.”
The killings have not been claimed.        
In November 2019, the UN children’s agency Unicef estimated that 855,000 children were without schooling in the two anglophone regions.
Around 90 percent of state primary schools and 77 percent of state secondary schools were either closed or non-operational at that time.
Anglophones account for about four million of Cameroon’s 23 million population.
Their presence is explained by the decolonization process in West Africa some 60 years ago.
In 1961, a British-ruled territory, the Southern Cameroons, voted to join the newly independent former French colony of Cameroon. The Northern Cameroons joined Nigeria.
There have been decades-long resentment among anglophones in Cameroon at perceived discrimination in such areas as education, the economy, and law.
Demands by moderates for reform and greater autonomy were rejected by the central government, leading to the declaration of independence as radicals became ascendant in the anglophone movement.

28th October 2020,American citizen kidnapped in Niger Republic,"An American citizen has been kidnapped by gunmen in southern Niger, a senior official told AFP on Tuesday.
The American, described as the son of a missionary living in Niger, was abducted by six men armed with Kalashnikovs on the outskirts of Massalata, a village about 10 kilometres (six miles) from the border with Nigeria, said the prefect of the Birni Nkonni department, Ibrahim Abba Lele.
They left on three motorcycles, heading for the border, he said, an account confirmed by the village chief, Ibrahim Dagual.
A man named Bruce Walton told local radio station Niyya that his son Philip Walton had been kidnapped from his home overnight by armed men.
 
“During the night six men, possibly Fulani, came on foot,” he said, referring to a nomadic ethnic group also known as Peuls.
“They were looking for money in the house but there was not enough. There were only 20,000 CFA francs ($35, 30 euros). After that, they left with him,” he said.
“All six men were armed,” Walton said, adding that they spoke in Hausa with a few words of English.      
Philip Walton had been living in Massalata with his wife and a child for two years, according to his father, who himself lives in Birni Nkonni and has been in Niger for nearly 30 years.
The US State Department said it was aware of an American citizen abducted in Niger. 
“We are providing their family all possible consular assistance,” it said.  Related News   Nigeria, Niger Republic sign communication agreement  Borno: Floods displace hundreds to Niger Republic  Buhari to attend AU summit in Niger Thursday   
– Ransom kidnappings –
Niger lies in the heart of the vast and impoverished Sahel, which is struggling with a jihadist insurgency that has claimed thousands of lives and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes.
Several Westerners are currently hostage in the region.
They include American aid worker Jeffery Woodke, who was kidnapped in the central town of Abalak in October 2016 and is believed to have been taken to neighbouring Mali.
Niger’s President Mahamadou Issoufou said in September last year that he had information that Woodke was alive and in good health.        
Three Europeans, including 75-year-old French charity worker Sophie Petronin, were released by their captors in Mali earlier this month under a prisoner swap arranged by the Malian government.
In August, six French aid workers and two Niger citizens were killed in the Koure wildlife reserve west of Niamey, in an attack claimed by the so-called Islamic State group.
Criminal gangs and cattle thieves often kidnap for ransom, and young Fulani herders make up many of the marauding gangs in northern Nigeria and other West African countries.
Niger also faces attacks by the Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram on its southeastern borders.
In addition to deadly raids, Boko Haram has increasingly carried out cross-border ransom kidnappings.

He was Prince David Jejelowo. He was from Eda Ile in the Ekiti East Local Government Area. We got married around 1994. We have three boys. He was a lover of peace. He was never a politician or a businessman. He was a good father.
He was very affectionate and I never saw him fight anyone. Even if anybody picked a quarrel with him, he would ignore the person and even sue for peace.
How did the incident happen?
 
The incident happened between 9pm and 10pm on Sunday, September 13, 2020, while we were watching the Newsline programme on the Nigerian Television Authority in the sitting room here. We had the window blinds closed. It was when the network news was about concluding that I noticed vibration on the window and not knowing that the person was tearing the net to enable him draw the blinds so that he could see us.
The moment I noticed that, I said, ‘Daddy, look at…’ and he was saying ‘Who is that? Who are you?’ So, the person replied with a gunshot and I ran. The person aimed at me. The bullets hit the wall at the entrance. Daddy was still wondering. The gunshots went on repeatedly and daddy was pinned to the corner. It was even this morning (Thursday) that we washed the blood stains. It was the Catholic Bishop of Ekiti Diocese, Felix Ajakaiye, who advised us when he came yesterday that we should clean the blood. We left the blood there for everybody to see. Our gate was locked that night and daddy even went to inspect it. The children usually locked the gate, and before retiring to the bedroom, daddy would go round the compound to make sure that everything was intact. That had been done before the incident. I didn’t see the assailant; the only thing I saw was a dark image.
After it happened, I started crying for help and shouting that robbers were in the house. Blood was oozing out of daddy. It was then that the children, who were woken by the gunshots, ran to their father with a view to rescuing him. They pulled him and rushed him to hospital. It was on the way that he passed away and the body was deposited in the mortuary.      
Did you get help when you called for it?
When we called for help, nobody came out. My children had taken their father down to the hospital before I started seeing people coming around.
What of the police?
After depositing his corpse in the morgue, the people, who came to me and later drove to the hospital to join my children, went to the Odo Ado Police Division on their way back from the hospital. They said they wrote a statement. We did not see any policeman, even on Monday and Tuesday. It was yesterday (Wednesday) after the bishop’s visit that three policemen came. When the bishop came, we were able to recover some bullets. He said he would go by himself to the police station. So, when the policemen came, they greeted me and said they were sent to the house to be with me. When they were leaving in the evening, they greeted me that another set would come, but I have not seen any other set of policemen.
When the sympathisers went to the Odo Ado Police Division, they reported the incident, but no policeman followed them to this place that night. We didn’t see any patrol team; there was no security of any kind except people in our environment.
Since that Sunday night, how has life been without your husband?
Life has been miserable. It is like I should follow him. I am even regretting it. Had it been I knew that he would not run, we would have stayed together so that we would have been cleared off together. Because I don’t know the type of country I am in a country where there is no justice. You cannot cry for help. A country where somebody can just come, kill and go. Last year, my husband was kidnapped for four days. It was the intervention of the whole of Ekiti State that saved him from almost being killed. If not for the intervention of people that God sent to us, he would have been killed then in the wilderness.        
But the death came right in his sitting room. He was killed in the house here like a beast for an offence we do not know when he committed. And I am very sure he didn’t commit any offence. He never had any quarrel with anyone. The only thing I know is that he was a very generous man. If any vulnerable person came here to seek help, he would come to their rescue, whether it was material or financial assistance. He was never an oppressor of any kind. We are devout Christians of the Christ Apostolic Church denomination; we hardly miss church programmes.
He was kidnapped for four days?
Yes. Between January 7 and January 10, 2019, he was kidnapped at Ago Aduloju while coming from his former office at the Gbonyin Local Government Council, where he worked as Director of Administration. He was on his way home. We were even planning to go for the New Year prayer in the church. He directed that I should go and that he would join me. On getting to the church, I called his phone and there was no response.
How was the experience in the four days?
The experience was tedious for me. In fact, I have had it so tough; it is so unfortunate. He was released after payment of ransom. They were calling us from the bush that he would be killed, that we should pay N10m ransom. We paid close to N3m. People contributed to it. We begged and sold what we could. It was the whole state that assisted us, because we are civil servants; we don’t have any business; we don’t have investments. They said he would be released immediately; we brought the N10m; we could not raise up to N3m until the fourth day; he was about to be killed then if not for the intervention of God and people in the state.
Were you able to get to the root of the kidnap?  Related News   
After his release, we couldn’t determine where the thing came from, but people said it was a mere coincidence. I interrogated him whether there was any Yoruba man among the kidnappers, but he said all those who kidnapped him were Bororo. He said the kidnappers spoke Fulfulde throughout the four days he was in captivity. He contemplated resigning from his work, but people said it was not up to that and that it was a mere coincidence. Ordinarily, the belief was that nobody could be after his life. They impressed on him to continue with his work following which he sought transfer which brought him to the Local Government Service Commission in Ado Ekiti. He was there till when he was finally murdered.      
It was gathered that his car was once stolen. Is this true?
Yes, that was in 2005. Before then, we were at Ise Ekiti; after we built this house, we moved to Ado Ekiti in 2004. It was the exact day that we clocked a year in this house. He bought a Mercedes Benz 200 and brought it home from the dealer’s shop on Friday; on Sunday, we took it to church, came home and in the evening, he wanted to go and show it to some well-wishers. But while coming back home around 7pm, when he got to the Mobil roundabout, the vehicle was snatched from him at gunpoint. That was October 31, 2005.
If we put all these together, don’t you think some people were after his life?
I do not know. All his friends are people in the church and at the workplace. He was not into anything shady, because he was a very honest person.
Didn’t you have any premonition that danger lurking around the corner?
No. He usually went to work alone. Although he received phone calls, which was the usual thing, at times I would say ‘daddy, you receive too much calls’, but he would say ‘You are a teacher while I am a local government employee; my workplace is like a family place, you cannot compare your phone calls with my own’. He would just joke about it like that.
But did you sense if he was being threatened on the phone?  
There was none. If he had received any threatening call, he would have told me. So, there was nothing like that.
What were his unfulfilled ambitions?
There were many. His ambition was to train his children to where they would be self-reliant. He used to say that he suffered, having lost his father at the age of 17, and at that age, he was able to get the primary school leaving certificate. He was at home for five years before he had the opportunity to train himself to secondary school. He used to say that if not for the background and that he lost his father at a tender age, that he would have been a professor by now; he was very brilliant. He then said that because of that, he would spare no expenses to train his children to any level, which he was doing. In fact, I know that wherever he might be now, he would be crying for the children.
He had reasonable number of children and said he would not give birth to many children that he would not be able to cater for.
What will you miss about him?
For me, he was a father, a mentor, my confidant and my friend. After God, he was next. In fact, I have never had any cause to regret marrying him. I tell my peers and family that if I come to this world 12 times, if it is possible, he would always be my husband. He could do menial jobs to ensure we had food. He made feeding a priority. When in bed together at night, I slept like a baby because he would cover you when it is cold.
How have your children been coping?      
They have been crying profusely. I have been trying to calm them; I put them in the hands of God. I don’t know why nature could have allowed this kind of situation to befall us in this house. I don’t have friends, daddy did not even create an avenue for that. I knew him at the age of 20. We were in school together. He never created that avenue for me to think of another person.
What do you want done about the killing?
I want God to do justice, because there is no justice in Nigeria now. I believe that the Lord that he served would do justice. God will expose the person(s) behind this. I want justice. I want justice from God and man. Let the person(s) responsible for this be exposed so that he/she/they can confess and tell the world what daddy did which was why he was so tormented to that extent. He was a CAC member, a lover of Apostle Joseph Ayo Babalola. He loved God till his death.    ,,

7th September 2020,"Gunmen kill three, kidnap scores in Kaduna community","Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna
Some gunmen in the early hours of Sunday invaded Buda community in the Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State and killed three persons.
The National President of Adara Development Association, Awemi Maisamari, who confirmed the attack, said scores of persons were also kidnapped during the incident.
Maisamari, in a statement in Kaduna on Sunday, claimed that the attack took place at about 2am when the natives were asleep.
 
The fresh attack occurred few days after the Justice Isa Aliyu-led Commission of Inquiry into the incessant violent crises in the Kajuru LG submitted its report to Governor Nasir El-Rufai.
Kajuru is located in Southern Kaduna.
The attack was coming when a peace process was ongoing in the troubled southern part of the state.      
The ADA President said it was becoming clearer that the purported dialogue was serving as a diversion to enable the attackers to continue their attacks.
The association said, “Today, Sunday, 6th September, 2020 at 2am, the Adara community of Buda, in Buda ward of Kajuru LGA came under another deadly attack from suspected Fulani militia.
“The premeditated and unprovoked attack claimed the lives of three people, namely Rev. Alubara Audu, 45, with five children; Adamu Tata, 40, with four children; and Ishaku Peter, 37, with five children. Furthermore, the following persons were abducted: Sani Peter, 25 and Esther Sani Peter, 20.
“At around the same time, the terrorists also abducted five people from neighboring Kemara Rimi community of Buda ward. They are: Ojo Aminu, 35;  Danfulani Makaranta, 37; Namiji Gwamna, 36; Ali Musa, 36 and Grace Matthew, 16.”  Related News   Gunmen invade Kaduna community, kill one, abduct 20   
The association said though “these callous and barbaric attacks sometimes abate, they never really stop in Adara community.”
It said, “On Sunday, 16th August, 2020, another fatal attack occurred at Kallah village on the banks of River Kaduna.
“This resulted in the death of Mr Danladi Abashi, a 50-year-old farmer who ventured near the villages that were invaded and are still occupied by Fulani herdsmen in the Kallah/Gefe/Libere area of Kajuru LGA. His body was only recovered with the help of the police because the herdsmen disallowed Adara people from even approaching the occupied enclave.        
“Similarly, the incidents of abductions of innocent people for ransom are also continuing. On 27th August, 2020, five incidents of kidnapping occurred, including that of Daniel Shuaibu and Abednego Paul from their residence at Maraban Kajuru.
“During the operation, Mr Sunday Barau was shot and injured and the abductees are still with their abductors because his helpless family has been unable to meet their demands.
The Kaduna State Government, in a statement by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, described the attacks as condemnable sheer evil.
The statement titled, “KDSG condemns bandit attacks in Giwa, Igabi, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru LGAs, praises peace initiative in Jema’a LGA,” quoted Governor Nasir El-Rufai as condoling with the families that lost their loved ones.
It added, “Security agencies have been directed to double up and intensify operations against bandits and raids on their hideouts.
“Our communities are strongly urged to stand together to confront criminality. Bandits should not be allowed to inflict such pain and then have their actions be allowed to divide their victims along religious and ethnic lines. This criminality is an attack on our unity and collective well-being.”

Some gunmen in the early hours of Sunday invaded Buda Community in Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State and killed three persons.
The National President of the Adara Development Association, Awemi Dio Maisamari, who confirmed the attack, said scores of persons were also kidnapped during the incident.
Maisamari, in a statement in Kaduna on Sunday, claimed that the attack took place about 2am when the natives were asleep.
 
The fresh attack occurred a few days after the Justice Isa Aliyu-led Commission of Inquiry into the incessant violent crises in the Kajuru LG, submitted its report to Governor Nasir El-Rufai.
Kajuru is located in Southern Kaduna.
The statement read, “Today, Sunday, 6th September 2020 at 2.00am, the Adara community of Buda, in Buda Ward of Kajuru LGA came under another deadly attack from suspected Fulani militia.

“The premeditated and unprovoked attack claimed the lives of three people namely Rev. Alubara Audu, 45, with five children; Adamu Tata, 40, with four children and Ishaku Peter, 37, with five children. Furthermore, the following persons were abducted – Sani Peter, 25 and Esther Sani Peter, 20.

The statement, also recalled that “these callous and barbaric attacks sometimes abate but never really stop in Adara community. On Sunday 16th August, 2020, another fatal attack occurred at Kallah village on the banks of river Kaduna.
“This resulted in the death of Mr. Danladi Abashi, a 50-year-old farmer who ventured near the villages that were invaded and are still occupied by Fulani herdsmen in the Kallah/Gefe/Libere area of Kajuru LGA. His body was only recovered with the help of the police because the herdsmen disallowed Adara people from even approaching the occupied enclave.
“Similarly, the incidents of abductions of innocent people for ransom are also continuing. On 27th August, 2020, five incidents of kidnapping occurred including that of Daniel Shuaibu and Abednego Paul from their residence at Maraban Kajuru.
“During the operation, Mr. Sunday Barau was shot and injured and the abductees are still with their abductors because his helpless family has been unable to meet their demands.        
“Another of the incidents is that of the abduction of Master Pius Gargai who was abducted from their family residence at Maraban Rido. He too is still with the kidnappers because of inability to meet their demands.
“Also, on 2nd September, 2020, four persons were abducted from Rafin Roro village in Kasuwan Magani Ward of Kajuru LGA. One of them managed to escape and three are still being held.”
The Kaduna State Police Command has yet to confirm the latest incident.

29th August 2020,"Boko Haram kills two, kidnap two in Borno - Report","Boko Haram jihadists on horseback killed two men and seized two others when they attacked farmers outside Maiduguri city in northeast Nigeria, anti-jihadist militia told AFP Saturday.
The insurgents rode into fields in Alau village on Friday, seizing four farmers, hacking two to death and kidnapping the others after inflicting machete cuts on them, the sources said.
“We recovered the bodies of the two slain farmers, bearing deep machete wounds to the head and torso,” militiaman Mohammed Bukar said.
“Farmers who escaped the assault said two others were injured and abducted by the attackers,” Bukar added.
 
The farmers were from a displaced camp on the outskirts of the city who grow crops in the village, said militia leader Babakura Kolo, confirming the death toll.
Around two million people have been displaced by the decade-long jihadist conflict. Many now live in camps where they rely on food and humanitarian assistance from aid agencies.
Some have turned to felling trees from the surrounding bushland to sell as firewood to make money to buy extra provision while others engage in subsistence farming in nearby fields.

Boko Haram has increasingly targeted loggers, herders and fishermen in their violent campaign, accusing them of spying and passing information to the military and the local militias fighting them.
Boko Haram’s insurgency, launched in northeast Nigeria in 2009, has killed more than 36,000 people and displaced more than two million from their homes.
The violence has since spread to Niger, Chad and Cameroon.
A regional military coalition involving troops from the four countries, is fighting to end the violence.

18th August 2020,"How herdsmen killed my fiancé, kidnapped me — Oyo female farmer","Deji Lambo
A businesswoman, Modupeoluwa Oyetoso, has been mourning the death of her fiancé, who was shot by suspected herdsmen at the Lanlete area of the Ibarapa East Local Government Area of Oyo State.
PUNCH Metro gathered that the lovers were returning from the farm when the four suspects waylaid them around 5pm.
While the fiancé was attempting to manoeuvre his way to escape the attack, one of the gunmen reportedly shot him.
 
“The bullet hit my fiancé at the back of his head. I didn’t know what to do, as the blood was rushing out of his head. I thought I could save him, so I attempted applying pressure to stop the blood, but I couldn’t do it because the car, which was still in motion, was about to hit a tree,” Oyetoso said during an interview with @twinklefiles on Youtube.
After managing to stop the vehicle, the assailants reportedly caught up with the businesswoman, whisked her away into a nearby forest and abandoned her fiancé for dead.
While in the forest, Oyetoso explained that the suspects “brought out a rope, tied my hands and one of them used the rope to pull me, while another one at the back was hitting me anytime I slowed down as we were running to leave the scene. When I slumped, they beat me and pulled me up. I had to summon the strength to run with them as it was raining.”      
PUNCH Metro was told that when the suspects got to a safe location, they instructed Oyetoso to contact her parents and demanded N50m for her release.
She said, “When we got to a place, they brought out my fiancé’s phone, removed his SIM card, inserted it into another phone and asked me to call my parents to inform them that they wanted N50m for my release.
“My dad started pleading with them and they told him that if he wanted to see me alive, he should find it. They spoke with him in Yoruba, but they communicated with themselves using another language.
“I farm in a place where we have a lot of Fulani settlers; I am familiar with them. They (suspects) were dressed like them, so, I know they were Fulani. In the forest, they told me they don’t have cattle and that the only thing they do is to kidnap for money. They said next time I see robbers, I should stop instead of running because what they want is just money. One of them even told me to take what happened as fate and at that point, I realised that they were thinking about my fiancé.

“The rain started and ended while we were in the forest. There was no shelter, and when we got to a particular point, there was a river and the current was heavy. One of them went through it first; I was shorter than them and when they told me to come around, I was really scared. My hands were tied, as I walked through the river and one of them just held on to the rope and pulled me as I passed through the river to get to the other side.”  Related News   
When Oyetoso’s parents were not forthcoming with the ransom the next day, the suspects reportedly threatened to kill and sell her body parts.        
“My dad kept begging them that it was a Saturday and no one keeps cash in the house. He explained to them that he was retired and did not know how he could raise the money and one of them shot in my direction because he felt my dad was taking them for a ride. They said if they did not get the money, they would kill me and get buyers for the body parts.
“My dad got to Eruwa around 9pm; he called them and three of them went to meet him and they left me with one of them. They told him to go to three different locations before they told him to drop the money somewhere; they wanted to know if he was being followed.
“After dropping the money, they told him to move ahead and after picking the money, they called the guy with me to bring me. While on the way to meet my dad, I met them counting the money. It took me about 15 minutes to get to my dad,” she added.
However, in a series of tweet, which was also posted on Instablog9ja, Oyetoso decried the state of insecurity in the Lanlete area, adding that two people were kidnapped a few days after she was released.

Using her Twitter handle @Doopeh, she wrote, “The Ibadan branch of the Poultry Association of Nigeria reported that more than 10 of their members have been victims within the past five months. Our story needs to come out, because there is so much that isn’t said about kidnapping.”
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Gbenga Fadeyi said, “Prior to the incident, we had massive deployments of police tactical teams on the routes. Several arrests have been made, with suspects paraded and charged for kidnappings, armed robberies, among others.      
“We also have collaborations with quasi-security groups, including vigilantes and hunters, to comb the bushes around the area. Stakeholders’ meetings have also been organised in that area.”

30th July 2020,Pastor kidnaps delivery man to raise money for Sallah charity,"Adelani Adepegba, Abuja
A pastor, Adetokunbo Adenopo, has been arrested for allegedly abducting a delivery man, Jonathan Ekpo, in order to obtain ransom from his employers for Sallah celebration.
The 52-year-old who is the founder of the New Life Church, Sagamu, Ogun State, allegedly carried out the act with his gang members, Chigozie William, 22; Linus Ugorji, 30; and Emmanuel Chris.
Ekpo had gone to deliver a package to Adenopo in Sagamu when the four men tied him up and anaesthetised him. They also kept him in an underground room until he was rescued by the police.
 
Narrating his ordeal to journalists during the parade of the suspects in Abuja on Wednesday, Ekpo explained that he was placing the package on the table at Adenopo’s church when the men grabbed and wrestled him to the ground.
He stated that he struggled to escape, but was injected with a substance by Adenopo, which made him lose consciousness.
“When I regained consciousness, I found my hands tied and my mouth and eyes covered up. They later removed the gag in my mouth and the mask on my face; they fed me with beans, garri and fufu so that I won’t have to go to the toilet,” the victim narrated.      
Explaining his role in the abduction, William said the pastor suggested the idea of obtaining ransom to fund his charity activities, adding that Adenopo promised to release Ekpo if his employers failed to meet their demands.
He stated, “The pastor invited the man to deliver some products. He said he wanted to collect money from his company to buy bags of rice and other things for the Sallah.  Related News   
READ ALSO: Gunmen attack Bullion van, kill four policemen in Ebonyi
“I asked him how long would the man stay with us and he said after this month, if there was no money (ransom), he would release the man. When the man came, we took him down and the pastor injected him. We took him to the underground. We used to feed the man every morning and night; that was the pastor’s instruction.”
Adenopo, who claimed to be a former pastor with the Living Faith Church, said he planned to use the ransom from the failed abduction to buy rams, rice and garri, which he intended to share to the poor in his community.
On his relationship with his accomplices, he said they were staying with him for security reasons, adding that he designed the underground room where the victim was kept “for certain situations and threats.”
The pastor, who appeared unperturbed by his arrest said, “A few weeks ago, we were short of funds and the idea of doing something during the Ileya (Sallah) came up because I don’t discriminate against any religion, so we planned to get some bags of beans, garri and ram and share to people.        
“That was why we came up with the idea of getting money from rich companies and use it to buy those items to start the project.”

13th June 2020,"How we terrorised Taraba, abducted many for ransoms  –Notorious kidnap suspects","Afeez Hanafi
Five suspects arrested for robbery, kidnapping and murder in Taraba State have owned up to the various roles they played in the criminal acts.
The suspects are Daniel Ihyar, Saheed Yakubu, Felix Agrema, Teitase Nyenkwa and Lukman Musa.
They were arrested recently in different locations by operatives of the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team.
 
City Round learnt that the suspects were members of various gangs that sprung up in the wake of clashes between Jukun and Tiv people in the state.
It was gathered the rising spate of kidnappings, armed robbery and murder perpetrated by the criminals made concerned locals to petition the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu.
The IG was said to have deployed the IRT team led by DCP Abba Kyari to track down the gangsters.      
Our correspondent learnt that the most notorious gang terrorising the state was headed by a fleeing 27-year-old man, identified as Joe Agrema, who is on police wanted list. Joe is said to be Felix’s elder brother.
He reportedly had about 10 AK-47 rifles in his armoury and led large members who carried out kidnapping, armed robbery and murder within Southern Taraba.
A police source stated that Joe, a Tiv, is highly feared by the Jukun people and his tribesmen. He reportedly threatened to kill anyone who condemned his criminal activities.
“Few weeks into the deployment of the detectives, four of Joe’s men, including his younger brother and two of his informants who monitored his victims, were arrested. They all confessed to the crime. Ihyar said Joe plotted to kill him because he left his gang to form his own,” a source told City Round.
Speaking during the week on his role as an informant to Joe, Yakubu explained that the kingpin paid him N10,000 for any assignment he carried out.
The 20-year-old suspect said the gang once killed a wrong target during an operation, an occurrence that angered Joe.
He said Joe asked him to locate the victim’s family and informed them that his gang was responsible for the killing.          Related News   
He said, “I am Fulani by tribe, but I was born in Gassol Local Government Area (Taraba State). I am also a tailor and I knew Joe through one of my friends. I am one of his informants and he sent me to monitor victims for him. One day, he sent his boys to kill someone at a general hospital. He instructed me to go to the hospital and confirm the identity of the man who was killed. When I got to the hospital, I was told that the person who was killed had been taken to a police station.
“I went there and confirmed that the person killed at the hospital wasn’t the main target. He was killed because when Joe’s men arrived there, they ordered everyone to lie on the floor and face the ground but when they were leaving, the man raised his head to see the faces of the people who came for the operation. He was shot and died at the spot.
“I relayed the information to Joe and he asked me to trace the victim’s family and when I got to the man’s house, I called Joe and he requested to speak to any of the man’s relative. I found one and he told the person on the phone that his boys wrongly killed the man but he was going to foot the bill for his burial. Joe also sent me to monitor a man known as Menassara, whom he wanted to kill. I had yet to complete the assignment before I was arrested. He gave me N10,000, whenever he sent me on an assignment.”
Yakubu stated that Joe also killed three of his (Yakubu’s) friends for supporting Junkun people during the crisis and speaking ill of him.
Ihyar, also a native of Gassol Local Government Area, explained that he fought alongside Joe last year in the communal clashes, adding that they later morphed into a kidnap gang.

He said, “I joined Joe during the Jukun and Tiv crisis which broke out last year. Joe is from the Dan Anancha area of our local government and we fought together during the crisis. Afterwards, Joe formed a kidnap gang with the guns he got during the crisis.      
“He has a camp inside the forest and he comes out with his men to kidnap or kill any one he has in mind. He had issues with people who criticise him for his criminal acts. He tried to kill one of them at Dan-Anancha General Hospital, where he was hospitalised. The man was lucky. He got information that Joe was coming and he escaped. Unfortunately, a wrong person was killed.
“I later stopped working with him and I formed my own gang using one of the revolver pistols my community bought for me during the crisis to rob people on the highway. Joe learnt about it and he started plotting how to kill me. Some of his boys who were loyal to me told me about the plan. I was trying to stay away from him when police arrested me.”
Joe’s younger brother, Felix, said he joined the gang in March 2020 and took part in an operation.
He said, ‘‘I joined him in kidnapping some Tiv delegates who were on their way home after visiting the governor in Jalingo. We blocked the expressway using army uniform and we abducted the delegates. The sum of N7m was paid for their release. I bought a car with my own share of the ransom.”

TWO Chinese nationals working at a mining site in Ebonyi State were reportedly kidnapped by gunmen at Ihietutu village in the Ishiagu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State.
It was gathered that the kidnapped Chinese nationals were employees of Greenfield Metals Nigeria Limited, a firm that specialises in lead and zinc mining.
The incident, it was learnt, happened on Wednesday in a mining pit at Ihietutu near the company’s office.
 
Chairman of the company, Henry Ahanaotu, said the gunmen first shot indiscriminately into the air to scare away workers before proceeding to whisk away the expatriates.
He said the incident happened at the company’s mining pit at Ajirija mining site, 300 metres from the company’s Life Camp.
Ahanaotu, who doubles as the Managing Director of the company, said a formal report on the incident had been lodged with the Ebonyi States Police Command in the state.      
He said the company had not made contact with the kidnappers.
“The unidentified persons bearing sophisticated arms stormed our mining pit at Ajirija and shot several times before whisking their victims away. We are yet to establish the identity of the abductors or where they came from,” he said.
The Ebonyi Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs Loveth Odah, confirmed the incident and added that the victims were kidnapped on Wednesday at the company’s mining site.

“But I can confirm to you that we received a distress call from the area yesterday, informing the police of an alleged abduction of two Chinese working in a mining site at Ihietutu in Ishiagu community.
“We are waiting for information from our men before we can make informed comments on the motive behind the alleged kidnapping.        
“For now, we cannot say if the abduction was for ransom purposes or not because the abductors have yet to establish contacts with the company,” she said.
Odah, however, urged non-Nigerians working in any part of the state to ensure they move about with armed security guards to prevent attacks and kidnapping by criminals.
This is the second kidnapping involving the company this year.

Edo State Commissioner for Science and Technology, Mr Emmanuel Agbale, has been reportedly kidnapped by gunmen who also killed his orderly.
The incident occurred on Friday along Benin-Ekpoma Road by Oil Palm Estate in Edo State.
The commissioner was on his way to Ekpoma when the gunmen reportedly opened fire on his vehicle.
 
It was learnt that the heavily armed men suddenly emerged from the bush and shot directly at Agbale’s car which forced the driver to stop.
“The police orderly was killed on the spot while the commissioner was whisked away,” a source told Sunday PUNCH.
The state Commissioner of Police, Lawan Jimeta, who confirmed the incident, described it as unfortunate.      
Jimeta however said his men were already on the trail of the kidnappers in the forest, promising that they would be arrested.
The Academic Staff Union of Universities, Ambrose Alli University chapter and the former Deputy Governor of the state, Dr Pius Odubu, condemned the kidnap of Agbale.
Odubu, while condemning the incident, bemoaned the increasing wave of criminal activities in various parts of the state.
He recalled that some criminals were last week reported to have murdered some farmers in Odighi community, Ovia North East Local Government Area of the state.  Related News   
The ex-deputy governor lamented that the incidents happened at a time the people of the state were trying to stay safe from the coronavirus pandemic, calling for concerted efforts by security agencies and government to curb crime.
He said, “I want to draw the attention of the Inspector-General of Police, Director General of the Department of State Services and the army to pay special attention to Edo State. The state government should invest more in protecting lives and property.’’
Odubu enjoined the security agencies to fish out the perpetrators with a view to bringing them to justice.        
He added, “No efforts should be spared in getting the commissioner released from captivity as the people of the state are now in perpetual fear in the midst of insecurity.

“The state must not pay lip service to security as the primary purpose of government is the security of lives and property. I condemn the incessant killings of farmers and other persons and the rising wave of kidnapping in our dear state.”
ASUU Chairman, AAU Chapter, Dr Monday Igbafen, in a statement on Saturday, said the union received with shock the news of Agbale’s kidnap.
“Our union decried the porous security situation in the country and urged the appropriate security agencies in the state to ensure his release unhurt without delay, while those involved should be fished out and prosecuted.
“The union also expressed its heartfelt condolences to the family of the killed police orderly,” Igbafen added.

10th April 2020,"Highway bandits kidnap 16, kill driver in Kaduna","Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna 
Despite the lockdown by the Kaduna State Government to curtail the spread of COVID-19, some bandits, suspected to be kidnappers, struck along the Kaduna-Birnin-Gwari highway, kidnapping no fewer than 16 persons.
The bandits, our correspondent gathered, struck along the Kaduna-Birnin-Gwari road and kidnapped family members being conveyed to Birnin Gwari for the burial of their breadwinner.
The incident, a source said, took place on Wednesday.
 
The Birnin Gwari road connects the state with Niger and Zamfara  states.
The driver of the vehicle was shot dead on the spot.
The remains of the driver were later evacuated by the military and the police on joint operations in the area, our correspondent gathered.      
According to the source, no fewer than five occupants of the vehicle were taken away by the bandits into the bush.  Related News   
The occupants of the vehicle included a woman, three of her children and one other person.
The source claimed the bandits stormed a nearby village where they took away about four villagers and stole cows as well as other animals.
He said, “Between Tuesday night and Wednesday, no fewer than 16 persons were abducted along the road, including those going for burial at Birnin Gwari.
“It has become a daily affair, though it has reduced because the military had stepped up operations in the area.
“From Uduwa to this place, the presence of the military is scaring them. The bandits usually carry out their operations early in the morning and by 9.00am, they are done. And also from 6.00pm when they know that the military men have left, they strike and operate into the night and the early hours of the day.”
Meanwhile, the Kaduna State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, told journalists that he had yet to receive briefing from the Divisional Police Officer of the area where the incident took place.

The Oyo State Police Command has confirmed the abduction of two sisters, Pastor Omobola Adepoju and Mrs Abiola Olukotun, from a farm in Ibadan on Monday.
The victims are the daughters of the former Director of Sports in the defunct old Western Region, and Proprietor of the Subuola Memorial Nursery/Primary School, Ibadan, the late Chief Emiola Adesina.
The news of their abduction was made known in a short message to one of our correspondents on Tuesday by a retired permanent secretary and professor/directing member of staff of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos, Plateau State, Tunji Olaopa.
 
According to the police, the community, where the victims were kidnapped, had been cordoned off by security agents in an effort to rescue them and arrest the abductors.
The Police Public Relations Officer in the command, Olugbenga Fadeyi, told one of our correspondents, “The women were kidnapped yesterday (Monday) on a farm in the Badeku area of Ibadan. The Commissioner of Police, Mr Shina Okukolu, has given an order to his men to bust the crime.
“As we speak, personnel of the Anti-Kidnapping Squad, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, the Special Tactical Team, the Police Tactical Team, the Operation Puff Adder, the IGP Tactical Team and the Federal SARS have all been deployed in the area.      
“They have cordoned off the area and are carrying out a massive manhunt for the kidnappers in order to secure the release of the victims. I spoke with the officer in charge of the Anti-Kidnapping Squad and he said policemen were combing the bush and the adjoining communities in an effort to secure the release of the victims.”
A close family source said on Tuesday that the funeral of Adesina held a week ago.
“Omobola came in from Atlanta, United States, and was with her sister on her farm at a location on the Ife Road in Ibadan when they were both kidnapped on Monday. The kidnappers have called the family to demand N100m,” the source stated.
When contacted, Abiola’s husband, Mr Kitolu Olukotun, said the abductors were six in number and alleged that three of them were Fulani herders, while the others were Yoruba.  Related News   Kidnapped Ogun journalist rescued in Lagos after gun battle  Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi  Gunmen kidnap Taraba monarch’s wives, son   
He stated, “My wife and sister-in-law went to the farm in the afternoon on Monday. Suddenly, the kidnappers emerged from the bush. According to one of my boys on the farm, they were six in number.
“Three of them are Fulani, while the remaining three are Yoruba. One of them was carrying an AK-47 rifle, which he fired in the air. They shot at the tyre of a vehicle and also fired a shot at the driver of our customers.
“They ransacked the vehicle. After that, they marched my wife and sister-in-law through the bush path. When they called me, they demanded N100m. But, I told them that I didn’t have such money. I told them to accept N1m, which they rejected. They then refused to speak with me again. They have been threatening my wife. They insisted that they would not take anything less than N20m.”        
Meanwhile, the police in a statement on Tuesday warned against the indiscriminate construction of unmanned community gates and careless patronage of commercial motorcyclists by residents of the state in view of the growing insecurity.
The statement read in part, “The Commissioner of Police wishes to draw the attention of members of the public to the indiscriminate construction of unmanned security gates in our communities and streets. The practice though appears to be a response to a security need, a review of the situation has shown that the strategy does not achieve much as criminals in our midst have continued to breach it.
“The recent experience of the police in response to distress calls has been frustrating. The CP, therefore, wishes to advise all and sundry to be circumspect with the construction and installation of unmanned security gates in their environment. It is professionally advisable that while we lock our doors and gates against intruders, we should be mindful of other exigencies.
“If there is a need at all to install security gates, we must endeavour to make them accessible to security agencies, who may be responding to distress calls or other emergencies like fire or other life-threatening health issues.”
The command also warned residents to be wary of kidnappers disguising as commercial motorcyclists, adding, “For instance, a case in point is the story of a commercial motorcyclist, who under the pretext of avoiding the task force, took two youngsters far beyond the gate of their school.
“The distress call by the youngsters attracted bystanders and a police team. The hoodlum was arrested and is being interrogated.”

24th February 2020,Cross Rivers: kidnappers abduct six residents in 10 days,"Ada Wodu, Calabar
No fewer than six persons have been kidnapped by gunmen in the last 10 days in Calabar, the Cross River State capital.
The kidnappers had demanded ransom totalling millions of naira from family members and relatives of the victims.
First, it was the associate professor with the University of Calabar, David Ugwu, who was whisked away from his home in Atimbo area of the metropolis.
 
Those who kidnapped him are asking for a ransom of N15m, just as an account worker with the Nigerian Chronicle, Maurice Archibong, was abducted last week Sunday with his abductors demanding N1.5m as ransom.
Also, a businessman, Desmond Oko, was whisked away from his business premises by gunmen last Tuesday. The kidnappers demanded N6m.
He was set free on Saturday after N2m was paid. Oko had also been kidnapped in 2018 at the same Goldie Street.      
Also kidnapped on Garden Street last Wednesday in Calabar were two brothers.
One of them called, Champion, was first kidnapped and when his brother went to pay the ransom, he too was seized by the kidnappers.  Related News   
Family sources said they were released after the payment of N3.5m.
Also, a Calabar-based socialite, whose identity has yet to be disclosed, was kidnapped on Saturday, Februray 22, 2020 in the Efio-Ete area of Calabar.
Sources close to Igbo businessmen, who are mostly victims of the kidnappings, said the top businessmen had reportedly sent a delegation to the Akwa Ibom State Government to allocate some parcels of land where they can build shops as Cross River was becoming too insecure.
 The state Police Command Public Relations Officer, Irene Ugbo, confirmed most of the incidents.
“We are aware that somebody has been kidnapped, but I have not been briefed by the anti-kidnapping squad if at all the matter has been reported to the squad,” she said while reacting to one of the incidents last week Wednesday.        
The Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade, had said during a TV programme at the weekend that kidnapping and cultism in the state were isolated incidents blown out of proportion by the media.

12th January 2020,"Some Miyetti Allah members are kidnapping, living in luxury, building houses in bushes — Adamawa vigilante, youth leader","You recently protested against the release of some kidnap suspects from police custody, what really happened?
We work hand in hand with security agencies, especially the Girei police division.  We suspected that some of the suspected kidnappers, whom we assisted in apprehending, were about to be released unconditionally. So we had to mobilise to ensure this never happened. Following the rising spate of kidnapping cases, we (youths) got tired and formed a vigilance group because the government was not helping in addressing insecurity. We patrol the town, using Dane Guns that each volunteer brought with them.
How did you know they were involved in kidnapping?
They are Fulani. They are our cattle rearers. My father owns cows. I’m a Fulani man in the town but they are Fulani people in the bush. When the going was good and we bought cattle, we would call these people to rear them for us. So, we know them. But we have been suspecting them and their activities, so we passed information to security agents. After a directive by the Divisional Police Officer, we went after them in the bush.
 
Do you have concrete evidence because suspicion is not enough?
We have informants. Those informants are their blood brothers whom we use to monitor and check their (Miyetti Allah) activities. Through our informants, we knew when they went out in the morning and returned at night. Sometimes, they could take as long as two or three days after leaving home, before they returned very late at night.
Secondly, they started living in opulence. They built houses in the bush, which is abnormal for a Fulani man working in the bush. That made us suspicious of their activities. If you are a Fulani man, you don’t build houses in the bush. Instead of being in the bush, they now moved to the city, which is abnormal. That made us to suspect them to be engaged in criminal activities. Our suspicion of their criminal activities now yielded results, so we went to look for them.      
READ ALSO: Oyo town’s only fire truck was faulty during Akesan fire – Moshood, state chief fire officer
How were they caught?
The DPO of Girei Divisional Police Headquarters issued search warrants and their homes were searched. When their homes were searched, we found various arms and ammunition. But we could not get anything at the residence of Ibrahim Jakka, who is the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigerian chairman in Girei Local Government Area. We learnt from his younger brother, Isa, that he is the leader of the kidnapping ring. Ibrahim Jakka was identified as a central figure involved in the clashes between farmers and herders in the area.
Why are you and others vehemently against the earlier release of Jakka and others after their arrest?
It is because our lives are in danger. Secondly, it was not the police that caught them. We led the police to arrest Jakka and his gang to have peace in our community. There was a time when certain members of Jakka’s gang were arrested and taken to the police station and it was Jakka that was responsible for their release.
When a directive was about to be given for the release of some of the suspects arrested, which we got to know about it through our sources on the ground, we had to quickly stage the protest which helped to foil the plan. This is a security issue. But the orders came from above. The commissioner of police was given the order. If not for our protest, what happened when Jakka was released after his arrest, along with two members of his gang, would have been repeated.
The first time Jakka was caught with two members of his gang in a market, he boasted after his release that even if he was caught 10 times, he would be set free 10 times. When I learnt about his bail, I led about 30 stakeholders to meet with the commissioner of police.        
The CP said he released Jakka because he denied being a kidnapper and promised to help the police arrest his brothers, whom he told the police were the kidnappers.
We later learnt from the CP that Jakka was granted bail (and asked) to bring the kidnappers after being taken to Abuja where he was released three weeks ago. Now, we are looking for Duna, Geide and Double who are relatives of Jakka. One of their brothers died and an informant told us that he spotted the wanted men at Damare.
He also said he spotted Geide, along with Ibrahim Jakka, Duna and Double. All the five wanted men were there, so we mobilised and went to where they were with Operation Farauta (an anti-crime outfit). We caught three of them. Geide, who was second on the police’s wanted list after Duna, was arrested but they left Ibrahim Jakka.
Even after the protest, I went to the commissioner of police to demand the rearrest of Ibrahim Jakka.
Why is the rearrest of Ibrahim Jakka so important to you?
His brother, Isa, has confessed that Jakka collected a ransom of over N1m. He mentioned the place and area. This same brother confessed that Ibrahim Jakka came to collect two AK 47 rifles and ransom from Geide, who was second on the police’s wanted list. Three of his brothers were involved in kidnapping and they have accused him of providing them with arms.
Are you alleging that the leader of the Miyetti Allah in Girei is involved in kidnapping?        Related News   Hoodlums killed 15 cows, kidnapped herdsman –Miyetti Allah  Jega, Miyetti Allah seek solution to farmers-herders conflict  Naira redesign: Miyetti Allah appeals for deadline extension   
Yes. Ibrahim Jakka is the leader of MACBAN in Girei. The link is that three of his blood brothers are suspected kidnappers. His younger brother, Isa, also confessed that he got two AK 47 rifles from Geide and Double.
When you arrested Jakka, did you question him before you handed him over to the police? What did he say?
Jakka said he was not a kidnapper and that he was just being accused falsely. Why should I believe him when he was always together with his brothers, who were kidnappers?
What is your next line of action now that he’s still at large?
Our next line of action is to urge the commissioner of police to order the arrest of Ibrahim Jakka over allegations that he’s in possession of a large cache of weapons used by the notorious kidnappers.
If Jakka is not a kidnapper, then he should be in a position to help the police to bring his brothers to justice.
After the protest, have the police reached out to you?  
Yes. According to them, they don’t have the intention of releasing the suspected kidnappers. The commissioner said there was no way the Force could have asked the DPO to release the suspects, and that they were working for peace and order. But they ordered the DPO to relocate the suspect by 6pm to Criminal Investigation Department; that was why we suspected foul play. If you ordered the transfer of the suspects, why not take them in the morning? Why did you have to wait until evening? If I had not been at the police station at the time, the police station could have been burnt.
Now that Jakka and one other suspect are still at large, are you not afraid that you may be targeted?
Of course, yes. I even need the assistance of the commissioner of police for protection. I am an indigene of Girei, I live here and there’s nowhere else for me to go.
Have you engaged the state chapter of the Miyetti Allah to complain and urge them to get rid of the bad eggs among them?
If in my capacity as the leader of the youths, I can take up the gauntlet in fighting crime, I expect other senior stakeholders like the district head to wade into the issue since it involves a leader of Miyetti Allah. But as I speak to you, there’s indifference. But Girei will not be safe until Ibrahim Jakka and other members of his family suspected to be kidnappers, are arrested and brought to justice.

What do you think can be done to improve security in your area and the state?      
If I say the security agencies have not been working, I would be unfair. All what has been achieved has been with the security agencies because we only assist them with information. The state governor is doing well; he gave us five motorbikes for our crime fighting activities. He also gave two vans to the police command in the local government area. One of the vans was used on the day we went to arrest the suspected kidnappers. But I would want to see more motivation from the government and synergy between the security agencies and the vigilance groups in the state.
But if there’s going to be peace in the council, the leadership of Miyetti Allah will have to step in because it is their leader in this council and members of his family who are allegedly behind insecurity in this area.
The government can look for the leadership of Miyetti Allah and seek the attention of traditional institutions so we can sit down and address the issues. We don’t want to believe Jakka’s claim that he only has two AK 47 rifles when we know he’s in possession of a large cache of arms.
Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in Adamawa, Rev Lawan Andimi, was recently kidnapped by Boko Haram and a video was recently released. How bad is the security situation in Adamawa now?
The situation is not stable. Just recently, a DPO was kidnapped. Before he was kidnapped, some professors were kidnapped. The situation has been hot and cold. But recently, it improved due to the activities of the Department of State Services, police and other security outfits like Operation Farauta, being supported by the state government.

Fr. Agwameseh, who is the parish priest of St. Lawrence Catholic Church, Issele-Mkpitime, was said to have been abducted on Saturday while returning from Onicha-Olona, where he had gone to produce the Sunday service bulletin for his parish when the kidnappers ambushed his car.
The Director of Social Communications, Catholic Diocese of Issele-Uku, Delta State, Rev. Fr. Charles Uganwa, who confirmed the abduction, stated that the hoodlums had established contact with some parishioners and demanded N20m ransom to free the priest.
 
He stated, “The priest was returning to his base in Issele-Mkpitime when he was attacked by Fulani herdsmen and whisked away to an unknown location.
“He was returning from Onicha-Olona, where he had gone to produce last Sunday’s  bulletin for his parish, when the kidnappers ambushed his car.”

Mohammed stated, “One Mr Ayinkor Umego of the Okpo village, Ekwulobia, reported at the Aguata Police Station around 9am that his wife prepared their three children for service at the St. Joseph Catholic Cathedral Church, Ekwulobia.
“However, while the children were playing on the field within the church premises, a man, whose identity is yet unknown, called the eldest child and sent him to go and buy three sachets of water from opposite the church, and before he came back from the errand, the man had disappeared with his younger brother, five-year-old Chimaobim Ayinkor, to unknown destination, and all efforts made to locate him by the parents have proved abortive.

The immigration officials, it was learnt, were on their way to Port Harcourt on an official assignment when they were suddenly double-crossed by the heavily armed hoodlums who  whisked them away.

The  pirates were also said to have shot indiscriminately  as they took their victims away to an unknown destination through the Bonny waterways.
“Yes, I got the information from the security formation in the area that they (immigration officers) were four in number and I was told that the pirates wore black attire during the attack,” a source from Bonny LGA said.      
“We do not know yet if the attack was an act of sabotage, but we have been campaigning against the continued kidnapping along our waterways. Now, it appears to have become worse.”
Another source from the area, told our correspondent that the pirates’ earlier attempt to hijack a passenger boat failed, because the speedboat carrying the bandits was far away from them (passengers).

31st October 2019,"Boko Haram jihadists kidnap doctor, nurse, driver in Chad","Boko Haram jihadists have kidnapped a hospital’s head doctor, a nurse and their driver in western Chad, civilian and military sources said Thursday.
It was the first abduction targeting medical personnel in the region, where Boko Haram has raided many villages, kidnapping mainly women, they said.
The medical team was headed to the town of Tchoukouliya on the northern shore of Lake Chad, a Boko Haram stronghold, when they were snatched on Wednesday, local governor Nouki Charfadine told AFP.
“The kidnappers took them away on a motorised canoe on the lake,” Charfadine said.
 
Boko Haram has training camps on several of the islands that dot the vast, shallow lake, which straddles the borders of Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon as well as Chad.

A high-ranking military official said on condition of anonymity that the three staff from the hospital in Bagassoula, all Chadians, had not notified authorities of their itinerary.      
“They were intercepted by Boko Haram elements, and local people alerted us after spotting their abandoned car with all four doors open,” the source said, adding that the army had launched a search for the victims.

Top military and government officials also pointed the finger at Boko Haram.
The jihadist insurgency, which broke out in northeastern Nigeria a decade ago, has spilt over into neighbouring countries.
In early September, Boko Haram killed four civilians and three soldiers in a week in the same area where Wednesday’s kidnapping occurred.
The attacks and military operations against Boko Haram have claimed some 35,000 lives since 2009.
This year alone 140,000 people have been displaced by renewed Boko Haram violence and more than three million people endure food insecurity as farmers have been unable to plant crops, according to the United Nations.
In 2015, the Lake Chad countries, together with Benin, set up a combined force to fight Boko Haram with the help of local groups of armed citizens.        
Boko Haram, loosely translated as “Western education is banned”, wants to create a hardline Islamic state.

Your daughter was recently kidnapped and N6m was demanded by the kidnappers as ransom, how did it happen?
It happened on a Monday around noon. My children were on their way home from school. A lady wearing hijab but with an opening showing her eyes took her. But unfortunately for her, my son was able to use her voice to identify her since she has stayed with us before. That was how my five-year-old daughter was kidnapped and her brother was left to go home.
Where were you at the time?
 
I was at home. My seven-year-old son came home crying that his sister had been taken away by their ‘aunty’ but that he was able to know it was her by her voice and eyes, which were exposed through the opening on her hijab.
So what came to your mind at that point?
I was shocked and highly surprised. I couldn’t imagine that my relation would do such a thing let alone to go ahead and execute such wickedness. This attempt was the third attempt to kidnap Aishatu.      
Were you afraid you might not see her again?
Despite my shock and surprise, I was not afraid; rather I was confident that I would do everything within my power to rescue her. I knew what transpired was the attack of an enemy. I chose to be confident instead of being in despair.
Why do you think your child was kidnapped?
It was obvious from her brother’s account of how she was taken away and the conversation I had with someone who requested for N6m that it was for money. They said she would be killed if I didn’t pay. I went to her school to complain that I had not seen my daughter. Then I proceeded to Pantami Police Division to complain. It was then I called Hadiza Babayo’s (the alleged kidnapper) father to verify her whereabouts and he confirmed that Hadiza was in Gombe. Then I told him about my ordeal. With the help of a few contacts I made about her whereabouts, we got her to the station.
Did the police assist you?
Yes, Gombe State Police Command assisted me a great deal in locating my daughter. The Commissioner of Police, Bello Makwashi, directed a team of Special Anti-Robbery Squad operatives to prevail on Hadiza. Fortunately, we were able to get the location of my daughter and Hadiza’s boyfriend, Bala Shuaibu.
I was very happy that they were able to resolve the kidnap case within 24 hours. I give them a 100 per cent pass mark for the job. It was a job well done.          Related News   Suspected cultists gang-rape Rivers pastor’s wife to death  Two abducted clerics regain freedom in Plateau  Kidnapped Nasarawa LG Chairman regains freedom   
How was she found?
She was found in a hotel around Nayi-Nawa area of the state. Hadiza was said to have hidden my daughter under her flowing hijab. The hotel manager claimed she had asked her what she had on her back, not knowing it was a child.
What was your reaction when you finally saw her again?
I was really excited; I couldn’t hide my happiness after seeing my Aishatu once again.
What was the first statement your child made to you when she saw you?
She looked very weak; all she said was ‘Baba (father)’. She was in a traumatic state. She said whenever she (Aishatu) said she wanted to see her father; they would pick up a knife and threaten to slit her throat.
How did she say she was treated?      
She wasn’t treated nicely; she said that they kept telling her they would kill her and her parents if they didn’t pay N6m ransom. She said she was given rice, but she refused to eat. They offered her apple, which she also rejected throughout her stay with them. She starved. It was when she was rescued and taken to the CP’s office that she agreed to eat the fruits offered to her by the commissioner of police, which was to get her relaxed.
The hotel should be closed down for not putting safety measures in place and for not insisting on seeing what was brought into their hotel. The manager should have investigated why a backpack had the shape of a human being under the flowing hijab.

What kind of relationship do you have with Hadiza as her uncle?
I’m a helpful uncle; she had stayed with me and my family here. I have done nothing wrong. Only recently, her father asked if he could send her to my house to stay as a way to prevent her from marrying her criminal boyfriend. I also promised to foot the marriage bill if she would get a good man as a husband.

27th September 2019,"Pirates attack boats, kidnap councillor, one other in Rivers","Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt
A councillor was one of two prominent persons from Bonny Local Government Area of Rivers State, who were kidnapped on Thursday by gunmen suspected to be sea pirates.
The gunmen had simultaneously attacked two passenger boats along the Bonny-Port Harcourt water route, dispossessing the occupants of the boats of their money and other belongings.
While one of the boats that was attacked was travelling to Port Harcourt from Bonny, the other vehicle was moving to Bonny from Port Harcourt.
 
A source from the area, who gave his name as Richy, said the whereabouts of the councillor and one other prominent Bonny indigene could not be ascertained as of the time of filing the reports.

“The two boats were attacked and while some of the passengers’ belonging, including cash, were taken away, they were allowed to go, however a councillor and another prominent person from Bonny were taken away by the gunmen.      
“This thing happened on Thursday, but till this moment (Friday) they are still missing. Governor Wike provided gunboats to ensure security on Bonny waterways, but what they do is to use the gunboats to escort expatriates and other big men.
“We are praying that those who kidnapped the two persons should set them free safely. This is not the first time this is happening. There have been incessant attacks by sea pirates and we are calling on government and security agencies to find a way of stopping it,” the source said.

“Yesterday (Thursday), we witnessed a very unfortunate incident on the Bonny-Port Harcourt sea routes, which the good people of Bonny have risen to condemn in all ramifications.
“As I speak, my heart is bleeding over the most recent pirate attack on innocent people of Bonny Constituency. It is very unfortunate and saddening that we are still at the mercy of sea pirates, who have continued to boldly attack us with impunity.
“Recall that the Rivers State Government, under the watch of the Governor Nyesom Wike recently launched ‘Operation Sting’ to address the security challenges of the state.
“The governor also donated a gunboat to complement the existing ones to effectively combat sea piracy and other forms of criminality on the Bonny-Port Harcourt sea route.        
“As I speak, two prominent Bonny sons have been kidnapped and the security agencies are doing everything humanly possible to secure their release. We are not happy with what has happened and we are condemning it,” the lawmaker added.
When contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Nnamdi Omoni, could not immediately confirm the incident, adding that nobody had officially reported the crime to the police.
Also, the spokesman of NNS Pathfinder, Lieutenant Jim Byang, told our correspondent that he was not aware of the incident."

7th September 2019,Taliban kidnap six journalists,"The Taliban have kidnapped six Afghan journalists working for private and government media organisations in eastern Paktia province, government officials and Taliban said on Saturday.
The reporters, working for radio and TV news companies that broadcast news in Pashto and Dari languages, were abducted while travelling in the group from neighbouring Paktika province to Paktia, to attend a media workshop on Friday.
“We are trying to negotiate their release with the Taliban,” said Abdullah Hasrat, a spokesman for Paktia’s governor.
Meanwhile, a Taliban spokesman confirmed the abduction of the six journalists by their fighters but said they would be released soon.
 
“Yes, our mujahideens (fighters) have mistakenly kidnapped them,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline insurgent group.

Afghanistan was rated the deadliest country in the world for a journalist to be in 2018, with 13 deaths, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
The International Federation of Journalists said 16 journalists were killed last year.
In June, the Taliban issued a threat to Afghan media, saying journalists will be targeted unless news outlets stopped broadcasting what they described as government propaganda against the insurgents.
Media organisations were given one week to stop transmitting “anti-Taliban advertisements’’ by the group’s military commission, a warning that was denounced by the Afghan government and western diplomats.
In 2016, a Taliban suicide bomber rammed his car into a bus carrying employees of Tolo TV, the country’s largest private broadcaster, killing seven journalists.
The Taliban said it killed the employees because Tolo was producing propaganda that supported the occupation of Afghanistan by the U.S. and its allies in their war against the insurgents.

28th August 2019,Gunmen kidnap Gov Okowa's sister-in-law,"Ochei Matthew, Asaba
Unknown gunmen have allegedly kidnapped the younger sister to wife of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, in Asaba, the state capital.
Elizabeth, younger sister to Dame Edith, was allegedly accosted by a gang of young men at Temple Clinic junction, along Awai road near Government House on Monday night in Asaba and taken away in a waiting vehicle.
The victim, who is the immediate younger sister of Okowa’s wife, was said to be driving a black Jeep when the gang abducted her
 
A source at the Government House in Asaba, who declined to be named, said the hoodlums were armed with dangerous weapons during the operation.
“They shot endlessly into the air to scare away people.
“Out of fear, the lady, who was ordered out of her vehicle, jumped into their waiting vehicle,” the source said.      
The top government functionary on Wednesday said the incident has since thrown the governor, wife and her entire family into trauma.
The source added that, for security reasons, the matter was not placed on red alert but that intelligence gathering had since commenced to rescue her unhurt.
The Commissioner of Police, Delta State Command, Adeyinka Adeleke, claimed ignorance and denied any knowledge of the alleged abduction.
Meanwhile, the source said no contact has been established with the family or any personality in government."
28th August 2019,"Three ABU law students, others kidnapped on Abuja-Kaduna Highway","Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna
At least seven persons, including three final-year law students of the Ahmadu Bello University, were reportedly kidnapped along Abuja – Kaduna, about 40 kilometres away from the state capital on Tuesday evening.
As of the time of filing this report, it was not clear whether the abductions took place at the same time a former Gombe State Governor, Ibrahim Dankwambo’s convoy ran into the kidnappers along the Abuja-Kaduna highway.
Security details of the former governor had to disperse the kidnappers operating along the highway when the former helmsman of Gombe state ran into them (kidnappers).
 
In a video trending on social media, a woman, who was stranded among others on the highway, was pleading for help from the former governor’s convoy.

But on Wednesday, a source who craved anonymity told our correspondent that no fewer than seven persons, including the ABU law students, were actually abducted on the Abuja – Kaduna highway on Tuesday.
According to the source, the incident occurred on Tuesday evening, noting, however, that no life was lost during the incident.
“There were seven kidnap cases including that of the three ABU students. There was no lost of lives. We are trailing the kidnappers,” said the source.
No fewer than eighteen persons had been kidnapped around the state in the past two weeks.
Meanwhile, the Management of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, has confirmed the abduction of three of its final year Law students on the Abuja-Kaduna highway.

According to a statement by the Director of Public Affairs, Dr. Ismail Shehu, the students were kidnapped along the Abuja-Kaduna expressway.

The statement reads in part, “Three students of the Faculty of Law were kidnapped on the Kaduna-Abuja Expressway.

“Yes, it is true that our students, three of them, from the Faculty of Law, have been kidnapped.

“But efforts are being made by the university and parents of the affected students to secure their immediate release.”"
27th August 2019,Kidnappers abduct members sent to deliver ransom  – Kaduna CAN,"Chidiebube Okeoma  and Godwin Isenyo
Two persons, who went to deliver ransom for the release of two children of a Kaduna-based bishop, have been abducted by the same gunmen, who had earlier kidnapped the children.
The Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria, Kaduna State, Rev. Joseph Hayab, disclosed on Monday.
He said the two persons were abducted by the bandits after collecting the ransom from them and failed to release the children of the bishop.
 
Hayab had earlier in a statement said the Senior Pastor of the Nagarta Baptist Church, Makeri, near Udawa in the Chikun Local Government Area of the state, was still being held by his abductors three weeks after he was kidnapped.
He appealed to security operatives to rescue the cleric and the bishop’s children.
Pastor Elisha Numan and his son, Emmanuel, were reportedly abducted by heavily armed men from their residence three weeks ago.      
But the son was later released so as to be used as a negotiating contact.
The abductors later called the family through Emmanuel to demand N20m ransom after they had threatened the pastor’s son to raise the money or his father would be killed within three days.
The kidnappers later reduced the ransom to N7m, according to the CAN chairman.
The CAN leader also stated that the pastor was ill when his abductors came calling.
He noted that one of the sons of the bishop was nine years old and appealed to his abductors to release him, because “he is not strong and mature to go through this torture.”
The CAN boss said, “Rev. Elisha Numan of the Baptist Church, Angwan Makeri, and the two children of one of our bishops in Kaduna are still with their of kidnappers. They were abducted about three weeks ago and are still being held in captivity till date.
“The church and their families are helpless and traumatised. We are once again calling on security agencies to do the needful and help secure the release of our people.          Related News   UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Teenager, guardian in court for kidnapping children  Kidnapper caught collecting N3m ransom from victim’s parents   
“Rev. Elisha was sick when he was kidnapped and we are afraid for his health. The son of our bishop is just nine years old. He is not strong and mature to go through this ordeal. We are appealing that these innocent people should be released.”
Meanwhile, the gunmen, who abducted the wife of the Anglican Bishop of the Ikeduru Diocese in Imo State, Anuri Maduwuike, have set her free.
She was released after an undisclosed amount was purportedly paid as ransom.
The bishop’s wife, who was waylaid and abducted on Friday at Ekemele, while she was going home from Owerri, was reportedly set free on Sunday by her abductors.
A source in the church, who did not want his name in print, told one of our correspondents on Monday that the kidnappers had earlier demanded N8m as ransom.
The source, who refused to disclose how much was paid for the woman to regain her freedom, said she was not released without payment.
He said, “To the glory of God, our bishop’s wife has been released. She was released on Sunday. Her kidnappers had initially demanded N8m ransom.      
“God answered our prayer and she was released unhurt. She has been reunited with her family. It was not a happy moment for the church of God. The diocese was in a sad mood until she was released.”
Our correspondent gathered that the bishop, Emmanuel Maduwuike, had a week before the abduction of his wife launched one of his books.
A source told our correspondent that the kidnappers might have thought that the bishop realised huge amount of money from the book launch.
The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Orlando Ikeokwu, could not be reached for comments, but a police source, who pleaded anonymity, confirmed the cleric wife’s release.

17th August 2019,Not only Christians are kidnapped in Kaduna — Muslim Council,"Godwin ISENYO, Kaduna.
The Council of Imams and Ulama on Saturday said the claims that only Christians are being kidnapped in Kaduna State, were false.
The Muslim group warned that security matters must not be politicised.
They argued that politicising security matters would only set the stage for an ethno-religious crisis in the state.
 
The Secretary of the Council, Yusuf Arigasiyu, who addressed a press conference in Kaduna on Saturday, insisted that many Muslims had over the years been kidnapped as well.  Related News   Kidnapped Ogun journalist rescued in Lagos after gun battle  Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi  Gunmen kidnap Taraba monarch’s wives, son   
According to him, it was divisive and false that claims that kidnappers only abduct Christians in Kaduna State.
Arigasiyu noted that kidnapping was a national security challenge,  adding that even the criminals as well as their victims cut across ethno-religious divides.      
He said, “Along Birnin Gwari-Kaduna Road alone, between 22nd June and 30th July 2019, over 55 persons have been kidnapped and over 20 persons were killed, including five Nigerian Air Force and Army personnel, according to news reports.
“Majority of the citizens killed and kidnapped along Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Igabi and Abuja-Kaduna roads and the border towns with Niger, Katsina and Zamfara States have been Muslims.
“We never viewed the unfortunate situation from a religious angle. In fact, we have always condemned the act of criminality and have called on the State and Federal Governments to protect the lives and property of all Nigerians, irrespective of where they are or how they worship.”"
17th August 2019,"Fulani herdsmen are also kidnapped, robbed  –Miyetti Allah South-East chairman","Alhaji Gidado Siddiki is the South-East Zonal Chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria. He tells RAPHAEL EDE some of the measures the association has put in place to curtail criminal activities allegedly carried out by Fulani people in the zone
Since when have you been living in the South-East?
I have been living in the South-East since 1986. I have also been living cordially and in harmony with the people. They take me as their brother; we work together, and they support me in all my business endeavours.
What has been your experience in that period?
 
My experience with the Igbo people has been good; they are peace-loving. They accommodate strangers more than the locals and they are hard-working. Anytime there is anything to discuss, they involve us.
What made you come up with a ban on herdsmen who have no family in the South-East from rearing cattle?
It is the decision of the entire herdsmen living in the South-East. We go for meetings and everybody has seen that these intruders are the people causing trouble in any state. If staying in your state would bring peace to you, why do you want to go to another state to cause problems for others? In the South-East, most of the time, you see people leaving minors with their cattle and going back to stay somewhere else. Those minors don’t even know the value of the cows they are rearing let alone the value of somebody’s property. They can destroy somebody’s farm because they don’t know its value. And when you destroy somebody’s crops, it is the same cows that would be sold to pay for whatever was destroyed. So if you cannot come here with your family so that we can monitor your minors, how they rear the cows, take your cows and children back to where you are staying so that they will monitor you very well there. Those of us (Fulani herdsmen) staying here in the South-East are with our cows and with this development, somebody from Anambra cannot come to Enugu; he has to stay in Anambra and somebody from North-West, North-Central, North-East to the South-East. We will not take that because if they are the ones bringing problems to those of us here, let them go; we will stay on our own.      
How would you describe the security situation in the country?
First, I will say that I am very disappointed with the way people take human lives and how people are politicising the security situation in the country. Lives and property are important and should be protected but people destroy them because of politics. I’m saying this because, on social media, some media houses speak against Fulani herdsmen as if they are the only people causing havoc in this country; as if they are the only people who are criminals; as if they are the only people who don’t want peace in this country, and to me it is not true. The Fulani man likes peace and he doesn’t like any crisis. But in any race or tribe, you cannot say everyone is a saint. In any society or tribe, I know a criminal is not a friend to anybody; he can victimise anybody. Our people are suffering from kidnapping – they kidnap our people and collect ransoms. They rob our people in the bush but nobody will hear about the cases because they don’t come out to narrate their experience. So people don’t know what they face. Our people are killed in crises and tribal wars in this country. Our people are suffering from so many things and they are not spared from all these problems but regrettably all the time, they are the only people that are being accused of being criminals. I don’t know where these accusations are coming from. Is it that the politicians want to use it as a political tool to fight another political party? Now in Nigeria, there is no criminal again apart from the Fulani; it is surprising to me. When there is any attack, kidnapping, robbery, Fulani herdsmen will be used as the headline and blamed for it.
People say in those days, Fulani people lived peacefully with host communities, what changed?
I think people who are in the opposition want to fight the government. When I say the government, I don’t mean only the Federal Government but government at all levels. Government at all levels have oppositions who don’t want them to be there. There is no administration in the South-East that has not put in place mechanisms to ensure peace. But still, people are against such efforts. I think they just want to create instability and destroy what the governors had put in place. In Enugu, for instance, we have peace and security committee. In this committee, we have leaders of the Christian Association of Nigeria, and representatives of farmers, herders, government, and security agencies.
I don’t know why people will be castigating the governors of the South-East that they are not doing anything. However, if any Fulani man or Igbo man is found to be a criminal or kidnapper, such a person should be treated as a criminal. We should not refer to people of an entire tribe as criminals.
What feedback have you received from herdsmen regarding the ban?
This decision was made by the herders living in the South-East. I am the chairman of a group and I am not talking for myself; I am talking on behalf of my group. We met and agreed on this; that is why I can come out to say it.        
How effective do you think it will be considering that many herders will be in the bush? How will the message get to such people?
Most of our businesses are done in the bush. So, we know where we meet them and we know how to disseminate information to them. We also know how to take action to implement it because it was a unanimous decision made by all of us. So, we have to work to make sure that we sanitise where we stay.
There have been attacks by suspected herdsmen in Enugu and other parts of the South-East in the past, how did you handle them?
A criminal is nobody’s friend. I told you that our members are being kidnapped and robbed in the forest. Who are those kidnapping them? Criminals! So, when you say herdsmen, you are using a blanket term for everybody. So we are against those people if they are herdsmen. We don’t know whether they are herdsmen or not but what we know is that a kidnapper kidnaps people and a robber robs people. So when you say they are herdsmen, that means you know who is responsible for those things. But I cannot prove the innocence of all the herdsmen. So a Fulani man is a Fulani but not every Fulani man is a herdsman. There are Fulani people who are not even doing the business of cattle rearing but they speak the language, behave like Fulani and look like other Fulani people. So if that person has done something to you, he will not become a herdsman because a herdsman is the one moving with his cattle. That is why we say we will tour all the cattle markets to sensitise our people to let them know if they are here in Enugu and not doing any business, they should leave this place. If a Fulani man fails to do so, we are going to fight him. We cannot leave any bad person to infiltrate where we stay. So, anybody who has nothing to do should go back and find something to do.  Related News   Legal practice redefined me – Blind lawyer  People don’t value counselling in Nigeria – Abiara  I didn’t know how to woo women — Signext MD, Bankole   
What else are you doing to prevent Fulani herdsmen/farmers clash in the region?
As Miyetti Allah, we have structures in the South-East. We have chairmen in the states, senatorial zones and local government areas; we have our boys everywhere. Whenever somebody calls to inform us that a farm was destroyed and describes the place, I send someone to assess the level of destruction along with the community leaders. After assessing the damage and establish the value of what was destroyed, my man will find out the person responsible for the destruction. He must find the man and the man must pay. If he refuses to pay, we the Miyetti Allah will use the police to arrest him so he can pay the farmer. So this is our mechanism to ensure peace.
What do you think about the suspension of RUGA programme by the Federal Government?      
I don’t know what they mean by RUGA. To my understanding, it is where Fulani people will settle. But I know Fulani are settling now. Why RUGA? I don’t know why people are saying that they want to establish RUGA. Maybe it means something that I don’t know about. I think we (Miyetti Allah) are the sole coordinators of herdsmen in Nigeria; they have not consulted with us about the RUGA establishment. In all these debates against RUGA or talks against it in the media, you will rarely hear the Miyetti Allah leader talking about RUGA because we have not been consulted. So when you want to do something for us, you should consult us. When you want to postpone something, you consult us. We don’t know what RUGA is.
What do you think about the proposed water resources bill that will give the Federal Government right over land around water areas, which many people believe is a tactic to give land and water sources to Fulani herdsmen?
I think we are supposed to be brothers and sisters. We have to love one another; a Nigerian is a Nigerian whether you are Fulani, Igbo or Yoruba. So if a programme will be done for the welfare of Igbo, if the Fulani man says he doesn’t like that programme, I think he doesn’t want Nigeria, he doesn’t want his brother and he doesn’t want himself. I have told you that Fulani people lack so many things because they only have one business – cattle rearing. The Federal Government should recruit 200 or 300 Fulani people; take them abroad to learn the modern ways of grazing cattle. When they come back, the government should start the business for them. As you can see now, 65 per cent of Fulani herdsmen in Nigeria don’t have cows again. They have lost their cows in different crises with their hosts; they fight them, kill them and kill their cattle. So many of them have lost their cows and are just roaming about. They are not educated, they don’t know any other business and they have no cattle. When those that will be trained start the business, others will see that the business is lucrative. I think others would stop going about with their cows and start the new system of grazing.
Are you saying that Fulani people don’t know any modern system of grazing?
Yes. Over 95 per cent of Fulani people in Nigeria do not know what ranching is all about. When I don’t know something and you are telling me to do that, I will feel that you just want me to lose what I am doing. But if I see somebody who is doing what you want me to do and he is making it, I will decide which one is profitable. Is it going about, suffering in the bush and quarrelling with people or staying in one place? So it is the government that is supposed to encourage people by doing that.
But there is this argument that cattle rearing is a personal business like farming, that the government should not be funding cattle rearing.
Why are you saying so? The government is funding agricultural businesses. They give farmers chemicals, fertilisers, and loans. Have you heard any amount that was approved for Fulani herdsman? The vaccination that they used to give to herdsmen’s cattle is not being done again. There is nothing for the Fulani man. So you see we are not benefiting from the government like that. Look at what is happening in Benue and Plateau; they have captured the date of all the farmers, and they will be paid but no Fulani man was consulted. They have killed their cattle, they have killed their people and nothing has been given to them. So the Fulani man is the loser in Nigeria. But about people saying that the Presidency is helping the Fulani; they should know we are not benefiting from the government. It is the farmers that benefit more from the government. There is nothing for Fulani man in Nigeria.  
What do you think is the solution to the problem of insecurity, killings and kidnapping across the country, some of which are said to be perpetrated by your kinsmen?
I will not accuse Fulani herdsmen because 95 per cent of them are not government workers. Ninety-five per cent of government workers are farmers, so they have to protect their brothers. The Fulani people are few and they have nobody to protect them; that is why they are saying that all the crises are being caused by Fulani herdsmen but it is not true. The solution is for the President to put a mechanism in place that will encourage communication between the farmers and herders so that everybody will know why they are causing problems for their counterpart. And people that will be put in the committee should be very sincere and they must understand that they are working as committee members.
You say Fulani people are not government workers but we know that many Fulani people are heads of top government ministries, departments and agencies. Even most of the security agencies are occupied by Fulani people. What do you have to say to that?
I have been telling you that Fulani herders are in the bush with their cattle; it’s not all Fulani people that are cattle herders. Those people you say occupy those positions; how many of them are herders or how many of their brothers are herders?
Are you saying that they don’t have feelings or connections with the herders in the bush?
No, I am not saying that they do not have feelings because they are brothers but they are not herders. There was a time people were fighting in Jalingo (in Taraba State). They blocked a road and said they were looking for Fulani men. The person you were looking for was not the person you were attacking. So it’s not everybody that is a Fulani herder. We have Fulani herders in the bush with their cows. We have Fulani cattle businessmen who you cannot call herders. We also have Fulani people who are in government; they don’t have any cow and they are not even ready to do the business.

16th August 2019,"17 Chinese, Ukrainian seamen kidnapped in Cameroonian waters","Nine Chinese and eight Ukrainian seamen were abducted in attacks on two merchant ships off Cameroon, in the latest act of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, sources said Friday.
The attacks took place on Thursday in Cameroonian waters off the port of Douala, located at the apex of a gulf that has become a hotspot of seaborne crime.
A Douala official told AFP on Friday that a total of 17 people had been abducted, including “nine Chinese civilian sailors” from one of the ships.
A Cameroonian security official, likewise speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the account.
 
The Cameroonian navy and the country’s port service had reported the kidnappings on Thursday but had been unable to give the number or nationality of those taken.
A navy source said the kidnappers “are probably Nigerian pirates,” adding that Cameroon’s security forces had launched a search for them.
The Gulf of Guinea, whose coastline stretches in a huge arc from Liberia to Gabon, is notorious for piracy as well as oil theft, illegal fishing and human and drugs trafficking.      
In Malaysia, Noel Choong, who heads the International Maritime Bureau, a watchdog agency, said the 17 seamen were seized from two ships that were attacked within hours of each other while they were anchored off Douala.
Choong said one of the ships was a multipurpose German-owned ship that flew the flag of Antigua and Barbuda.
“Eight crew were kidnapped from the ship, consisting of a total of 12 Asian and European sailors,” he said.
The other vessel was a Liberian-flagged bulk carrier managed in Greece with a Greek owner.  Related News   UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Teenager, guardian in court for kidnapping children  Kidnapper caught collecting N3m ransom from victim’s parents   
“There were 21 crew on board. All were Asians. Nine crew were taken,” Choong told AFP.
“(The) IMB has issued a warning to all ships at Douala. We ask all ships to take additional precaution.”
Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement quoted by news agencies that three of the kidnapped sailors were Russian nationals. Many Ukrainians also hold Russian citizenship.        
– Piracy epicentre –
In recent years, the seas off West Africa have become “the world’s worst for pirate attacks,” according to the IMB.
Attacks doubled in the Gulf of Guinea in 2018 compared to the previous year — the bulk of them due to piracy, it said.
Of the 75 seafarers taken hostage in the first half of this year, 62 were abducted in the gulf, IMB figures showed.
The Gulf of Guinea now accounts for 73 percent of kidnappings and 92 percent of hostage-takings at sea worldwide, particularly off the coast of Nigeria, Guinea, Togo, Benin and Cameroon.
The 17 countries bordering the Gulf of Guinea and adjacent coastline have limited surveillance and maritime defence capabilities.
They have been trying for several years to bolster their means of intervention and to put in place closer collaboration.
Ten Turkish sailors were freed last week after being kidnapped by “pirates” off Nigeria last month. Pirates normally seize sailors hoping to be paid ransom.

6th August 2019,"ICYMI: Why we attack, kidnap people - Repentant Fulani bandits","Some repentant bandits in Tsafe Local Government Area of Zamfara State, on Monday, explained why they took up arms against the people of the area.
The ex-bandits said at a peace meeting in Tsafe that they were harassed and intimidated by the police and vigilantes, locally known as ”Yan Sakai, into becoming bandits and kidnappers.
During the meeting held at the palace of the Emir of Tsafe, Alhaji Muhammadu Bawa, one of the bandits’ commanders, Hassan Dantawaye, said they were unjustly treated by the government and society.
“We were forced into this because apart from cattle rustling incidents we faced some years back, we also faced serious harassment and intimidation from security personnel and ”Yansakai.
 
“We cannot go to markets, our children cannot go to school, whenever they see our children or wives in town they killed them.
“If security personnel arrest us, we have to spend a lot of money before we are released, sometimes security agencies launch attacks on our homes and kill us without any offence.
“With this ugly trend, we have no option than to embark on kidnapping, attacks, and other crimes,” Dantawaye said.      
Alhaji Madele, a Fulani leader, however, thanked the state government for the dialogue and urged the security agencies to protect them from ”Yansakai and some security personnel who attack them unjustly in markets and towns.
Madele said, “we have agreed to embrace peace and dialogue, we commend the commissioner of police for inviting us for this meeting”.
The repentant bandits’ commanders also promised to release all captives in their custody.
Nobody will be attacked anymore, they pledged, adding that farmers in the area were free to go to their farms without any fear.
The Chairman of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) in the area, Alhaji Yahaya Ahmad, assured everyone of total support to the peace initiative.

Nagoggo said, “I remember the day I arrived this state as commissioner of police, over 30 persons were killed in Shinkafi local government area.
“After identifying the measures to tackle the problem, the state government came up with the peace and dialogue initiative with the warring parties as part of measures to provide a lasting solution to the problem.
“We embarked on consultation with Fulani leaders, Civilian JTF, and Vigilante Groups which led to the successes we are recording today.
“From the inception of this dialogue to date we have rescued over 300 kidnapped victims from the bandits without payment of ransom,” he said.      
He added: “As I always say, most of the extrajudicial killings and illegal attacks on communities were as a result of the actions of the outlawed vigilante group of “Yansakai, who were taking the law into their hands.
“Our aim is to have sustainable peace and development in the state, therefore, all stakeholders should cooperate with us in this task.
“I am also reissuing this warning that all activities of “Yansakai are suspended and nobody should take the law into their hands.
“Anybody found violating these directives would face the full wrath of the law”, the Police boss added.
The Emir of Tsafe, Alhaji Muhammadu Bawa thanked the warring parties for attending the meeting and accepting peace.
Bawa said the emirate would continue to support the state government to ensure that the dialogue succeeds.
The News Agency of Nigeria recalls that the state governor, Alhaji Bello Matawalle initated the peace dialogue as part of measures to end banditry, kidnapping and other crimes in the state.  
The meeting in Tsafe was attended by repentant bandits’ commanders, members of the CJTF, officials of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association and members of the outlawed ”Yansakai local vigilantes.

Gunmen numbering about 13 allegedly invaded Senator Elisha Abbo’s family home in the early hours of Saturday and killed his uncle, David Ella.
According to sources, the gangsters also abducted Abbo’s stepmother who was delivered of a baby   11 days ago.
The lawmaker, who was caught slapping a lady in a viral video recently,  stated these while addressing journalists in Abuja.
 
Abbo is the representative of  Adamawa North in the Senate.
He said, “About 13 men armed with AK-47 rifles invaded my family house around 1am on Saturday and shot my uncle dead.
“They dragged my father and brothers out of their rooms and went after my stepmother when they were told that my biological mother was dead.      
“They took the poor woman away and left behind her 11 day-old child.
“My stepmother is still with the kidnappers now (as of 5:30pm on Saturday) The kidnappers have called me, using  a Cameroonian MTN number, but they had yet to demand a  ransom.”
Abbo lamented that the hoodlums were hiding just about two kilometres away from Mubi town but that neither the military nor the police had been able to dislodge them.
He said,  “The Federal Government, the military and the police are not doing enough in the aspect of insecurity in this country.
“The security agencies know the hideouts of the criminals but they will not go after them.
“Of what use is the army barracks and the mobile police base in Mubi when they cannot go into the bush and dislodge the kidnappers?

Abbo told one of our correspondents that many Nigerians were not interested in what happened at the sex toy shop.
He said he was called by his wife’s younger sister that his only sister had been killed.
The senator said,  “I asked what really happened to her and she (wife’s sister)  responded that she (Senator’s sister) was hit, then I thought it was a car.      
“On getting there with my brother, I found my sister lying in a  pool of her own vomit and naked.
“So, I had to cover her first before calling the management of the  Maitama Hospital to bring an ambulance.
“Asking what happened from a passerby, I confirmed that someone hit her but not with a car.
“Suddenly a boy came and hit me on the head saying ‘call Buhari if you can’.
“For what? I asked him, because I was surprised and confused.
“Then,  the lady beside the sex shop pushed me and slapped me, ordering me to get out of the way and shouted,  ‘get out’.
“I realised she was the one who dragged my sister on the floor. That was where my anger set in.”  
Abbo added, “Instead of showing sympathy and concern for the dying girl, the owner of the shop   pulled her like a ragout of her shop, telling her not to die there.”
The Senator said the situation got him angry and decided to call the police.
He said,  “I wasn’t  going about with security personnel as of that time because I was not yet a Senator.”

6th June 2019,Two Canadian women kidnapped from golf club in Ghana,"Two Canadian women have been abducted in Ghana, police said Thursday, a rare attack in a country seen as one of the most secure in the West African region.
The Canadians, charity volunteers aged 19 and 20, were taken on Tuesday evening in Kumasi, Ghana’s second city, some 200 kilometres (125 miles) northwest of the capital Accra, David Eklu, Assistant Commissioner of Police said in a statement.
“Police Command is investigating a complaint of kidnapping at Ahodwo, Kumasi Royal Golf Club, at 8:25 pm on 4 June 2019, where two women of Canadian nationality were kidnapped,” Eklu said.
“Investigation started immediately upon receipt of the complaint, and the security agencies are working closely together to get them rescued, and the perpetrators arrested,” he added.

Police did not release the names of the women.
But they said they are volunteers with a group Youth Challenge International, a Canadian international development organisation with its headquarters in Toronto.      
The group works in 16 countries across South America, Africa and Asia, working to support development projects for young people in areas such as health, education and employment.
“The general public is urged to assist the police by volunteering information,” Eklu added.
Security sources suggested this was a kidnapping for ransom.

Kidnappings and violent crime towards foreigners are rare in Ghana.  Related News   Ghana removes fuel subsidy  Canada bans aluminium, steel imports from Russia  Canadian companies licensed to sell cocaine   
But earlier this year, local media quoted President Nana Akufo-Addo as warning that action must be taken to make sure kidnapping “doesn’t become a feature of our society.”
In April, an Indian man was reportedly abducted, also in Kumasi, by an armed gang demanding a cash ransom. He was swiftly rescued by police.
Tourism is an important industry for Ghana, and Kumasi, the historic capital of the Ashanti kingdom, is a favourite destination.        
Ghana is a country of some 30 million people, where more than two-thirds of people follow Christianity and the rest of Islam and other religions.
It has long been seen as a bulwark of stability in a region struggling to contain multiple groups of Islamist fighters.
Akufo-Addo, speaking on Wednesday to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al Fitr, called on the Ghanaian people to protect religious tolerance.
“We are the envy of the world when it comes to the peaceful co-existence of different religious communities,” Akufo-Addo said in a speech, according to the presidency.
He also urged people to “report suspicious characters” to the police.
“We cannot surrender this beautiful way of life for anything, and, certainly, not to people who seek to pervert religious beliefs,” Akufo-Addi added.

Gunmen suspected to be members of the Boko Haram sect have kidnapped a National Youth Service Corps member, Abraham Amuta and a cleric with Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel), identified as Pastor Oyeleke in Borno State.
Friends of the corps member said on Twitter that they were abducted two weeks ago on their way to Chibok to distribute relief items to Internally Displaced Persons and evangelise.
It was said that they were in a vehicle alongside some other passengers when the attack occurred.
 
Amuta, it was learnt, is the only son of his parents.
One of his friends, who goes by the name Success Ezeanya, wrote, “Abraham Amuta is a corps member serving in Maiduguri. He was abducted by Boko Haram two weeks ago. He went for evangelism with a pastor from his church – Living Faith. He is an only son. Let’s not forget him in our prayers.
“He is a Batch B, stream 1 corps member serving in Maiduguri, Borno State. It’s been over two weeks now since he went missing in Maiduguri. Some people claiming to be Boko Haram have called and claimed to have abducted him. Please retweet until the Federal Government sees this.”      
Due to the volatile nature of Borno State, corps members are usually given the option to redeploy.

He also told them that they are major stakeholders in the task of the development of the state.
According to him, the state still pays monthly allowances of N10,000 to all categories of corps members; N50,000 to paramedics graduates and N100,000 to corps members who are medical doctors.

He insisted that the concern of the corps members should be to serve and not to go and indoctrinate the host communities.
“Let me, however, warn you that you are posted to go and serve and not to go and evangelise. Your concern should be to serve and not to go and indoctrinate your host communities. Conversion of souls is not your concern,” Kazaure had said.

The Emir of Bungudu in Zamfara State, Alhaji Hassan Attahiru, on Wednesday said bandits who attacked his domain on Saturday kidnapped 30 people.
The emir had in an interview with The PUNCH on Tuesday said the Nigerian Air Force ignored distress calls when the bandits attacked his domain and killed 15 people on Saturday, but NAF in a statement on Wednesday said the monarch’s claim was mischievous.
But the emir on Wednesday commended the media for bringing into national focus the appalling security situation in his domain.
 
He stated, “It reached a situation that my people were afraid for my life, asking me not to visit certain places, for me not to be kidnapped.
“Apart from the 15 people killed when the bandits invaded Makwa village, 30 others were kidnapped and whisked away to unknown destinations by the bandits.
“The kidnapped victims upon payment of ransom, which the state government frowned upon, are usually freed.”      
On a claim that security agents of the Operation Sharan Daji and Habun Kunama III, went after the bandits and rescued some of the kidnapped victims in Bungudu, the emir stated that the troops should not claim credit for what they did not do.
He stated, “Those they claimed they rescued are escapees from the kidnappers. The troops saw the escapees returning home. They never engaged the bandits during the attack to rescue the kidnapped victims.
“There are places that the bandits have established camps in the last four years and they are still there, they have not moved an inch.
“The security agencies have this information. The information given to them years ago is still very valid but they don’t make use of it.
“If their problem is dearth of personnel, let them admit and collectively, we can sit down to address it. Unfortunately, there is a lack of synergy between the security agencies and the people who are more familiar with the terrain.”

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Lagos State Fire Service boss and six others were abducted on April 6 while returning from an official function.
They were abducted by a seven-man gang at the Ketu-Ereyun, Ikorodu-Epe road.
The abducted victims were, however, freed three days after their kidnap.
 
The two suspects — Blessing Boyo and Smart Alfred — were paraded on Thursday at the Lagos State Police Command by the Commissioner of Police, CP Zubairu Muazu.
The suspects claimed they were paid the ransom in cash before the victims were released.
According to Boyo, 29, their gang leader, simply identified as MK, who arranged the kidnap and received the ransom on behalf of the gang, was yet to share the money before the arrest.      
“I am from Arogbo in Ondo State. I work and live in Ondo State as a timber operator. It was MK, who is my senior friend, that came to call me for a job.
“He brought me to Lagos. He is also an operator, but he did not tell me it was kidnapping. He took me to the bush where there were other guys waiting.
“It was when I got to the bush that he revealed the nature of the job I was going to do. He brought out four guns and when it was time to strike, MK and one other member of the gang blocked the road with a timber.

Unidentified gunmen believed to be Fulani herdsmen have invaded Numa village in the Andaha community of the Akwanga Local Government Area of Nasarawa State.
During the attack, which occurred on Sunday, the herdsmen killed 16 people, including a 100-year- old man, during a naming ceremony.
The people killed were from the Mada ethnic group in the state. It was learnt that the suspected herdsmen raped a Mada girl to death.
 
The senator representing Nasarawa North senatorial District at the National Assembly, Philip Gyunka, who confirmed the incident to The PUNCH in Akwanga, the headquarters of Akwanga Local Government Area, stated that the victims, comprising a man, his wife and their son, were killed during the attack.
Gyunka, who described the killings as unfortunate and barbaric, said, “The unfortunate thing is that the victims-the father, mother and their boy-were killed. A pregnant woman was involved in this attack. An aged person, above 100 years, was also involved in the attack. They did not spare women or children and these were the people that didn’t have arms.”
He said he recently moved a motion on the floor of the Senate calling on the Federal Government to establish a military base in Akwanga.      
Gyunka said, “You can see the increase in kidnappings and robberies on the Akwanga – Abuja Road. This is as result of people moving with weapons unchecked.”
Also, the Paramount ruler of the Mada, HRH Samuel Gamu-Yare, in an interview with one of our correspondents said 16 persons were killed during the attack.
He said, “We have 16 deaths while several others were critically injured. The attack on this community occurred within a short period. The militias met people during the naming ceremony and they resorted to sporadic shooting.
“It is quite unfortunate and devastating that a peaceful and law-abiding community like mine, which over decades have never involved in skirmishes either internally or externally, would be attacked by Fulani herdsmen when in a celebratory mood..”
The Commissioner of Police, Nasarawa State Command, Mr Bola Longe, could not be reached on the phone as of the time of filling in this report neither had he responded to a text message sent to his mobile phone.
Herdsmen abducted 67 Taraba residents in five months
Meanwhile, no fewer than 67 persons have been kidnapped and several others killed in Taraba State between November 2018 and March 2019 in Lau, Jalingo, Donga and Takum Local Government Areas of Nasarawa State.

The Caretaker Chairman of Takum Local Government Area, Shiban Tikari, told The PUNCH in a telephone interview that 35 people had been kidnapped in his local government area from November to date.
Also, the Chairman, Donga Local Government Area, Nashuka Ipeyen, said nine persons were kidnapped in the area between January and March this year. It was learnt that six persons were reportedly abducted by gunmen in Jalingo Local Government Area within the period.
Though the Jalingo Local Government Caretaker Chairman, Abdulnaseer Boboji, told one of our correspondents that he would provide the official figure after cross-checking his records, he never did as of the time of filling this report.
However, a senior official in the council, who pleaded anonymity, confirmed that six people, including the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Darius Ishaku; a prominent civil servant and the immediate past Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association, Jalingo branch, were kidnapped in Jalingo.
In the Lau Local Government Area of the state, the Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria in the area, Rev. Fr. Sunday Patrick Muke, said 17 people were kidnapped from Lau between November 2018 and March, this year.
Some residents, who spoke to one of our correspondents on the wave of kidnapping and killing in the area, blamed politicians for the rising insecurity.      
A resident of the Takum Local Government Area, Mr Musa Tsokwa, lamented that if adequate measures were put in place after the kidnap and subsequent killing of a lawmaker, Hosea Ibi, the problem would have been solved.
He said, “Other than tackle the issue and properly address it, the first high-profile kidnapping in the state (Hosea Ibi’s case) was shrouded in secrecy and a particular tribe was stereotyped as brains behind the evil when it was clear that other ethnic groups were also involved in the crime.
“Has anyone cared to know why all of a sudden kidnapping has become so lucrative in Taraba? Most kidnappings in the state go unreported and the state government has not done enough to address the issue.”
Taraba not silent over killings, kidnappings – Dan Abu  Related News   Suspected herdsmen kill woman returning from farm in Benue  Enugu holds security meeting over  killings by herdsmen  Miyetti Allah disowns herdsmen over killing of female farmer in Enugu   
But the Taraba State Government has denied allegations that it was silent over the killings and kidnappings in some parts of the state.
The Senior Special Assistant to Governor Darius Ishaku on Media and Publicity, Mr Dan Abu, said the state government had done enough in ending killings and kidnappings in the state.
Abu explained that several meetings between the Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, and his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom, were held in Wukari with a view to finding lasting solutions to the problems.  
He said, “Even now that Governor Ishaku is out of the country, the Deputy Governor, Haruna Manu, is fully on the ground and he is currently meeting with the deputy governor of Benue State in Wukari to look into the crisis there.
“The two governors have taken the issue of security on the border of the two states very seriously and that is why during their last meeting in January over border security they both agreed to offer amnesty to criminals in Taraba and Benue to end trans-border killings and kidnappings.
“At the moment, documentation of those criminals willing to accept amnesty is going on. Government officials in the affected local governments have been directed to liaise with stakeholders on their localities for the documentation and once that is completed, amnesty will be given to repentant criminals.”
However, a youth leader in Takum and Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Revenue Mobilisation, Joseph Manga, has urged those involved in kidnapping and other crimes to have a rethink of their activities.
While appealing to those involved in the act to freely come out and embrace the amnesty of the state government, Manga called on the stakeholders in various areas to assist in prevailing on the young people to renounce criminality.
But the Caretaker Chairman of Takum Local Government Area, Shiban Tikari, doubted whether the amnesty would yield the needed result.
Tikari said, “One notorious criminal popularly called ‘Crack’ was given amnesty but he later returned to the criminal world, same thing with ‘Gana.’ So, I doubt if the amnesty initiative of the two governors will work.      
“In my last security meeting last Wednesday, I pleaded with the traditional rulers to prevail on the criminals to release the people they are still holding.
“For instance, Alhaji Mayo was kidnapped in Takum during the presidential election and so far N105m has been paid as ransom but they are still keeping him. Dr Sule Audu was kidnapped and N7m was paid yet he is also being held by the kidnappers.
“Now that government is considering the amnesty option for them, my plea is that they should release these people they are keeping and embrace the government gesture. But my reservations remain whether they will come for the amnesty programme with one mind,” he said.
On its part, the Benue State Government said it was considering the amnesty programme for repentant criminals in the state.
The Special Adviser on Media to the Benue State Governor, Tahav Agerzua, said on Monday that Ortom had earlier in his first term in office introduced amnesty.
According to Agerzua, the governor said in Wukari that he was ready to grant amnesty to whoever was ready to surrender arms.

He said, “At the time the governor (Ortom) visited Wukari on a peace meeting with his counterpart in Taraba in January, he made it clear that he was ready to grant amnesty to anyone that was ready to surrender his arms.
“Remember that Governor Ortom introduced amnesty programme in 2016 in the state and he is ready to grant amnesty to anyone who surrenders arms again. That is the reason he made the declaration at Wukari in Taraba State during the peace meeting.”
This, Agerzua said, would help to stop the incessant killings within the border communities of Benue and Taraba states.

12th April 2019,Two Cuban doctors kidnapped in Kenya,"Suspected Somali Al-Shabaab jihadis kidnapped two Cuban doctors in northeastern Kenya on Friday and killed their police escort officer, officials said.
Kenya and Somalia are working together to pursue the abductors, they said.
The operation happened as the two doctors — a general practitioner and a surgeon — were going to work in the town of Mandera, near the border with Somalia.
“Today at around 9:00 am, suspected Al-Shabaab militants abducted the two Cuban doctors stationed at the Mandera County Referral Hospital,” the county’s governor, Ali Roba said in a statement.
 
Kenyan police spokesman Charles Owino said the assailants used two Toyota Probox cars to block the vehicle that the doctors were travelling in.
One of two police officers escorting them “was shot by the attackers and died on the spot. The attackers succeeded to abduct the two doctors and crossed the border with them,” said Owino.
The driver of the doctors’ vehicle was arrested and is being questioned, he said.      
A senior police officer, who asked not to be named, told AFP:  “From the modus operandi and the fact that they went towards the Somalia border, we have reasons to believe that the kidnappers are Al-Shabaab.”
“Our security agencies are working with Somalia Government Security agencies to pursue the abductors into Somalia with the objective of rescuing the victims,” Kenyan police chief Hillary Mutyambai said in a statement.
The two doctors, whose names have not been released, are part of a group of about 100 Cubans who came to Kenya last year to help boost health services.
In Cuba a health ministry statement  read on television said:  “Channels of communication have been established immediately with the Kenyan authorities to address this situation, while keeping the collaborators’ family members here in Cuba informed. Likewise, a government working group has been set up to follow up on this sensitive issue.”  Related News   Three arrested for match-fixing in Kenya  Kenya suspends two more players for match fixing  Kenya suspends 16 players, coaches for match fixing   
Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Shabaab militants have been waging an insurgency against Somalia’s foreign-backed government for over a decade.
Last November, an armed gang seized Silvia Romano, 23, an Italian charity worker, in the southeastern town of Chakama. Her whereabouts are unknown.
Police at the time warned against any speculation that the Shabaab may have been involved in her abduction.        
– Jihadist attacks –
The Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda affiliate, have been fighting since 2007 to topple Somalia’s fragile government, which is backed by a 20,000-strong African Union force, Amisom.
The Shabaab fled fixed positions they once held in Mogadishu in 2011, and have since lost many of their strongholds.
But they retain control of large rural swathes of the country, and continue to wage a guerrilla war against the authorities, striking at the heart of Somalia’s government.
The group has carried out a number of attacks in Kenya in reprisal for the country’s participation in Amisom.
Kidnappings in Kenya are relatively rare but can have a devastating impact on tourism, a major income-earner.
In 2011, a British man, David Tebbutt, was killed and his wife, Judith, was kidnapped by gunmen who took her into Somalia and held her for ransom for six months.
That attack, and the kidnapping weeks later of a Frenchwoman on the Lamu archipelago and two Spanish aid workers from a refugee camp in northeast Kenya, were seen as a trigger for Kenya’s invasion of southern Somalia to attack Islamist bases there.

10th March 2019,"Four killed, one kidnapped in Rivers violence","Chukwudi Akasike, Eric Dumo and Sampson Itode
A policeman and three others were killed by suspected gunmen while a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mrs. Emilia Nte, was kidnapped in Rivers State.
This is just as ballot box snatching and vote-buying characterised the exercise in some parts of the state.
The policeman was said to have tried to protect Nte, who is a former council chairperson, from being abducted when the gunmen shot him. The incident happened at about 6pm on Friday in Nyeada, Andoni Local Government Area of the state.
 
Nte, according to a source from the area, was returning home when the gunmen accosted her vehicle, attacked the policeman before whisking her away.
Though report stated that Nte was shot dead, the state Police Public Relations Office, Nnamdi Omoni, said she was kidnapped and not killed.
“It was the policeman, who tried to engage the gunmen, that was killed and not the woman. The woman was kidnapped by the gunmen,” Omoni stressed.      
Also, at about 3am on Saturday, one Michael Abednego was killed in Akinima, Ahoada West LGA of the state by a security agent suspected to be a mobile policeman attached to an unidentified politician.
It was also gathered that a man and a woman leader of the All Progressives Congress lost their lives in another gun attack in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni LGA.
Omoni confirmed Abednego’s death, adding that the police had yet to get the full details of what happened.
He also promised to find out what happened in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni, where two persons were reportedly killed.

Low turnout of voters and reported cases of ballot box snatching marred Saturday’s elections in the state. The exercise, which failed to start at most polling units as of 9am, was characterised by heavy deployment of policemen and army personnel in most of the places visited by our correspondents.
In the few places that witnessed high voter turnout, agents of some political parties were seeing inducing voters with money to vote for their candidates.
In Abonnema community, suspected armed thugs reportedly snatched ballot boxes as voters voted. The incidents took place in Wards 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 12 according to findings by our correspondents. The situation sent panic across the coastal town. Similarly, there were sporadic shooting in Ward 13, Unit 007, Mbodo, Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state.        
Three gunmen on motorcycles attempted to snatch ballot boxes at the place but were repelled by heavily-armed policemen, who rushed to the scene after being alerted to the incident.
Most parts of Port Harcourt witnessed downpour on Saturday thus bringing the exercise to an end in most polling units.
A former governor of the state and Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, described the elections in the state as relatively peaceful. Amaechi, who is also the leader of the All Progressive Congress in the state, said there was no record of violence compared to what was witnessed in previous elections in the state.
But the state governor, Nyesom Wike, said the military should be blamed for the voter apathy experienced during the elections.
Wike stated this while speaking with journalists after voting with his wife, Justice Eberechi Suzzette Nyesom-Wike, at Unit 7, Ward 9 in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area.

10th March 2019,Bandits kidnap INEC official in Sokoto,"Adeniyi Olugbemi
An official of the Independent National Electoral Commission was kidnapped by suspected bandits in Dangwandi village, Gebe district of Isa Local Government Area of Sokoto State.
This is coming after four persons were killed, including two policemen and several others were kidnapped along the dreaded Sokoto-Isa road on Friday.
The Executive Secretary, Isa Local Government Council, Alhaji Muhammad Makoshi, dropped the hint while speaking with journalists who were on election monitoring in the area.
 
He said the victim, Surajo Muhammad, who is a Presiding Officer in charge of the area, was kidnapped while on duty.
Makoshi said the incident was confirmed few hours after a call was put through to the victim’s phone line but one of the kidnappers responded that the victim had been abducted.
“We just received the news that one of the INEC Presiding Officers has been kidnapped in Dangwandi village of Gebe district. He was on supervision tour of the area when he was abducted.        Related News   UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Teenager, guardian in court for kidnapping children  Kidnapper caught collecting N3m ransom from victim’s parents   
“We have called his phone line and one of the kidnappers has confirmed that he had been kidnapped. But we will try our best to ensure that he is set free,” he explained.
The Executive Secretary, however, decried the incessant killings and kidnappings of innocent citizens of the area by bandits.
“Just yesterday, four persons were killed, including two policemen and several others were kidnapped along Sokoto-Isa road. During the incident, about eight vehicles were stopped and the occupants were abducted,” he further disclosed.
Makoshi noted that although the security agencies are trying their best to salvage the ugly trend, he, however, urged the Federal Government to further deploy more security personnel to complement the existing ones.

Suspected kidnappers are believed to have abducted the 80-year-old mother of Binta Masari, the wife of the Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari.
Credible sources revealed that Hajiya Maistiyari was kidnapped early Friday morning at her residence in Sabon Gari area of Katsina.
Our correspondent found out that the octogenarian’s abductors came on motorcycles, had hoods to conceal their identity and were said to be armed. They reportedly stormed the house around 3 am and whisked her away after maltreating other occupants of the house.
 
The Katsina State Government and the State Police Command had yet to officially react to the kidnap of Hajiya Maistiyari as of Friday night.
Several unsuccessful efforts were made at getting the reactions of the Spokesman for the State Police Command, SP Gambo Isah, and the Police Commissioner, Sanusi Buba, at the command’s headquarters in Katsina, as none of their mobile telephone lines were reachable.
They were said to be at a meeting in connection with the governorship and state House of Assembly elections.      
The state’s Information Commissioner, Hamzat Brodo, could also not be reached for comments as several calls to his official line were not answered.

7th March 2019,Pirates kidnap three Romanian sailors,"Anna Okon
Pirates have reportedly kidnapped three Romanian sailors aboard a tanker ship off Lome, Togo.
This was after sea robbers attempted to board a container ship owned by Singapore’s Pacific International Lines while the vessel was sailing on the high sea around Nigeria’s Niger Delta region on February 21.
According to the Romanian Free Trade Union of Navigators, the 40,500 deadweight tonnage tanker named “Histria Ivory” was attacked by the pirates some 20 miles from the Port of Lome.
 
They said after activating the alarm, the majority of the 21 Romanian sailors on board the ship mustered in the citadel, the pirates, however, kidnapped three crew members and escaped.
No injuries to the remaining crew members were reported.
After the pirates left, the 2006-built vessel was escorted by local authorities into the safe anchorage of Lomé. The vessel sustained damages during the hijack and needed to be repaired.      
“The case is now under the responsibility of the competent entities that will take the appropriate measures to ensure that the sailors are released safely,” the union said.
At the time of the incident, the medium range 1 tanker was en route from Freetown to Monrovia, reports said.
The Histria Ivory continued its voyage to Monrovia, the ship’s AIS data showed.  Related News   Police rescue 28 kidnapped Akwa Ibom fishermen  Navy debunks pirates' invasion of Akwa Ibom beach  Navy deploys two helicopters, 10 gunships against pirates

On the attempt to board the PIL ship, Asian anti-piracy watchdog, ReCAAP said “more than four men armed with guns onboard an unlit fast boat” attempted to board the 3,889 Twenty Equivalent Unit Kota Satria on February 21.
ReCAAP said two of the perpetrators attempted to hook a ladder to the ship’s hull but were not successful and slowed down the pursuit.
The suspected armed robbers reportedly fired two gunshots toward the ship’s bridge and subsequently to the ship’s accommodation.        
“Kota Satria’s master initiated security procedure and contacted company security officer as well as the company’s armed escort vessel and the Nigerian Navy and carried out evasive manoeuvre. Consequently, the fast boat aborted the pursuit.
“There were no injuries to the ship’s crew and no damage to the vessel reported. In addition, no items were stolen,” ReCAAP said.
After the incident, the post-Panamax box ship met an armed escort ship and proceeded to Onne Port in Rivers State.

“According to the women, three of the kidnappers covered their faces and one did not, we don’t know if they did that to conceal their identities, we don’t know if they are youths from our community or not,” another source added.
The Police Public Relations Officer of the Delta State Police Command, Mr Andrew Aniamaka, confirmed the incident when contacted.
He suggested that the abduction was suspected to have been carried out by community youths, whom he said would be apprehended soon and made to face the law.
He said, “The DPO, Ashaka, has confirmed it: he’s a 70-year-old man and since the abductors have not called to ask for ransom, there are indications that the abduction is an inside job and the youths might be at the heart of it.        
“From what has been gathered, he was abducted alongside two of his female workers, who were later released. The police have commenced works on the matter, to ensure he is released as soon as possible.”"

Several crew members have been reported missing following a pirate attack on one of Mediterranean Shipping Company’s container ships off the coast of Benin (Republic of Benin), West Africa, according to worldmaritimenews.com.
A small container ship belonging to MSC was attacked on January 2, 2019, in the Gulf of Guinea and several crew members were reported as missing, a spokesman for the shipping firm confirmed to World Maritime News.
He said, “MSC quickly secured the vessel and its cargo and ensured the safety of the remaining seafarers on board.”
 
He added, “Out of respect for the missing crew members and their families, MSC has no further comment for the time being.”
Media reports suggested that the vessel in question was the 46,852 dwt MSC Mandy.
A warning notice issued by NATO’s Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade – Gulf of Guinea (MDAT-GoG), revealed that the vessel was attacked and boarded by pirates some 55 nautical miles off the coast of Cotonou, while it was traversing through the Gulf of Guinea.

A kidnap and robbery ring operating on the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway and Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, has been busted with four members of the gang arrested.
The suspects are Babangida Garba, Sani Mohammed, Ibrahim Dogo and Ibrahim Haruna.
City Round learnt that the suspects met their Waterloo sometime in November as one of them wanted to pick up N1m ransom for the release of one Alhaji Ulere, who they had kidnapped in Abuja.
 
 Ulere sells cows in the Luge area of the Federal Capital Territory.
It was gathered that Mohammed, who masterminded the kidnap, had worked for the businessman as a herder until 2016 when he left after he was accused of stealing a cow.
READ ALSO: NSCDC assaults two journalists in Nasarawa      
Our correspondent learnt that one of the suspects had pretended to be a customer and called Ulere on the telephone, asking the businessman to meet him along the road to his shop in Luge.
As he wanted to attend to the impostor at the agreed location, other gang members reportedly ambushed him and took him to their camp in the City Gate area.
They subsequently contacted his family and demanded that they pay N1m ransom within 48 hours or lose Ulere.
A family member was said to have reported the incident to the Inspector General of Police Intelligence Response Team led by DCP Abba Kyari and was asked to play along with the gang.
 A police source told our reporter that one of the abductors, Dogo, came out of the camp to collect the ransom from Ulere’s relative unknown to him that detectives were monitoring his movement.
The source said, “The kidnappers believed that the ransom they demanded was ready and one of them, Dogo, went to receive the ransom around City Gate area of Abuja. He was arrested. He led the operatives to the camp where the victim was held hostage. Dogo’s gang members got wind of the police invasion of the camp and fled.
 “They were traced to their base in Enugu State, apprehended and their guns were recovered. They confessed to have carried out several armed robberies and a series of kidnappings at various locations on the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway. One AK-47 rifle and three locally made guns were recovered from them.          Related News   UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Three arrested for killing Philippine governor  Teenager, guardian in court for kidnapping children   
 “Mohammed confessed that he led his gang to kidnap his former boss because the man accused him of stealing one of his cows. They threatened to kill the businessman if his relatives did not pay the N1m ransom within 48 hours.”
 Mohammed, who spoke in Hausa to City Round through an interpreter, confessed to have participated in several robberies and a series of kidnappings with the gang.
While recalling the chain of events leading to his criminal escapades and how he became a member of the gang, the native of Zamfara State explained that he joined the ring two years ago.
He said, “I was rearing cattle, which was my father’s business. I have no formal education. I came to Abuja in 2007 and started working for Alhaji Ulere. Our relationship went sour in 2016 when he accused me of stealing a cow. I left him and travelled to Enugu State to meet my friend, Babangida, who was also rearing cattle.
 “On getting there, I discovered that he already had a gang that was into armed robbery and kidnapping. I joined him and we started robbing motorists travelling on the Enugu Port-Harcourt Expressway. We normally blocked the expressway with heavy wood at night.
 “We would force the vehicles to stop and rob the occupants of their cash and other valuables. We kidnapped victims that appeared rich and took them into the bush. We released them after collecting ransoms from their relatives.

“In November, I told Babangida that my former boss wrongly accused me of stealing and I suggested that we should kidnap him. Babangida agreed and he called other gang members to inform them. We went to Abuja and contacted Alhaji on the phone. As he came out, we kidnapped him and kept him in a bush in Abuja. We demanded a ransom of N1m from his family.  We didn’t know that they would inform the police.
“We were waiting for Dogo to bring the money when we got information that the police were coming after us. We fled to Enugu where we were later arrested.”
Mohammed’s accomplice, Haruna, said he got the highest share of the crime proceeds because the AK-47 used by the gang belonged to him.
He regretted to have participated in Ulere’s kidnap, adding that Babangida invited him for the operation.

22nd November 2018,Boko Haram kidnaps 50 loggers in Borno,"Boko Haram jihadists abducted around 50 loggers near the northeastern Nigerian town of Gamboru close to the border with Cameroon, civilian militia and residents told AFP Thursday.
The hostages who are mostly from a camp for people displaced by jihadist violence were on Saturday rounded up by fighters loyal to factional leader Abubakar Shekau while collecting wood at Bulakesa village, 25 kilometres (15 miles) from Gamboru in Borno state.
“The men were rounded up and taken away by Boko Haram insurgents and nothing has been heard from them,” militia leader Umar Kachalla said.

“Two of the loggers escaped and returned home and broke the news.
“We don’t have a precise number of those taken but usually the loggers move in a group of more than 50 men,” Kachalla said.
The loggers were encouraged to venture deep into the bush to collect firewood by a recent military operation that pushed the jihadists out of the area, another militia Shehu Mada said.      
Last month troops dislodged the militants from the nearby town of Wulgo and surrounding areas following incessant attacks on loggers.
“The general assumption was that the insurgents had left the area only to suddenly appear and encircle the loggers,” Mada said.

“We believe the number of the those abducted exceeds 50,” said Gamboru resident Babagana Musa.
The story was slow to emerge due to limited communications with Gamboru residents.
The area has for several years been without telecom facilities following the destruction of telecom masts in Boko Haram attacks, forcing residents to rely on Cameroon mobile phone networks.
Gamboru loggers have suffered repeated Boko Haram attacks and abductions especially around Wulgo forest which was a known Boko Haram hideout.        
In April Boko Haram militants gunned down 18 loggers at the edge of Wulgo forest, 15 kilometres from Gamboru, while returning from collecting wood.
In January at least 31 loggers went missing and were believed to have been abducted by the jihadists near Wulgo, where 10 loggers were killed two weeks earlier."
21st November 2018,Gunmen kidnap Italian woman in Kenya,"An armed gang abducted an Italian woman from a village in southeast Kenya, shooting and wounding five residents in the raid, police said Wednesday.
“The attackers fired indiscriminately at residents” before kidnapping the 23-year-old, who worked as a volunteer for an Italian charity, during the attack after dark on Tuesday at Chakama, a small village in the coastal Kilifi county, police said in a statement.
Three children were among those injured, with one, a 10-year-old boy, shot in the eye, according to police.
The wounded have been taken to hospital and police have been “deployed to track down the criminals”.
 
Italy’s foreign ministry named the victim as Silvia Romano.

Africa Milele Onlus, the small Italian charity for which Romano was volunteering, posted a statement on its website saying: “There are no words to comment on what is happening. Silvia, we are all with you.”      
Ronald Kazungu, a Chakama resident who witnessed Romano’s abduction, said the gang had come to the village looking for “the foreigner”.
“Six men came asking for the foreigner. I told them she had gone (out). They began arguing, saying they had seen her in the house. It was then that I showed them where she was,” he said.
– ‘We need money’ –
Another witness, James Alexander, said the gunmen had thrown an explosive device during the attack. “I found something on the floor. Suddenly it blew up and I saw someone in front of me with a gun,” he said.

“Immediately he started shooting so I had to run away. Coming back I saw them taking the lady down towards the riverside. They were asking her for money: ‘We need money, we are not going to hurt you’,” he said.
The kidnappers are believed to have escaped with their victim across the Galana river. The village is about 60 kilometres (40 miles) inland from the coastal town of Malindi, which is popular with Italian tourists and expatriates.
Kenyan police warned against speculation, rife in the local Kenyan press, that Shabaab militants from Somalia might be behind the abduction.
Police chief Joseph Boinnet said he did not yet know who the attackers were. “We are investigating, but people should stop speculating,” he told reporters.        
Another police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity about the ongoing investigation, said: “We understand that there has been a dispute at that orphanage and that is what we are looking at.”
Kidnappings of foreigners are rare in Kenya, but have a damaging effect on the country’s crucial tourism sector.
A spate of abductions on the coast in 2011 saw a British man shot dead and his wife kidnapped from a resort island, while weeks later a French woman was abducted from her home on the Lamu archipelago.
Soon afterwards Shabaab gunmen abducted two Spanish aid workers from the Dadaab refugee camp close to the Somali border in the only confirmed case of kidnapping inside Kenya by the jihadists.

PUNCH Metro learnt that 24-year-old Innocent had been kidnapped along with the victim in her apartment on Aparazu Ogwu Community in Abia State.
A source said the victim, after she was released, said Innocent was always urging her to persuade her family to pay the ransom demanded by the kidnappers.
The IRT reportedly invited the suspect for questioning after a petition had been written to the Inspector- General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, by a relative of the victim, Agnes Simion.      
Upon interrogation, Innocent allegedly confessed to the crime of masterminding the kidnap of his girlfriend’s widowed mother, adding that the move was to punish her for allowing his girlfriend to date another man.
The Abia State Indigene said, “I reside at Aparazu Ogwu community with my cousin. The woman we kidnapped was my girlfriend’s mother. They have a telecom mast in their compound and I used to go to their house to charge my phone. I made friends with them and the woman’s second daughter became my girlfriend.
“A few months into our relationship, I discovered that my girlfriend was seeing someone else. I confronted her about it and she threatened to end the relationship. I told her mother about it but she did nothing.
“My cousin in whose house I reside in Aparazu Ogwu community approached me and sold the idea of kidnapping to me. He told me that one of his friends, known as Onyemywa, who has made money from kidnapping told him that people in the community could pay us huge money when we kidnap them.  I suggested that we kidnap my girlfriend’s mother.  Related News   UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Three arrested for killing Philippine governor  Teenager, guardian in court for kidnapping children   
“The woman has been nice to me, but the misunderstanding between her daughter and I made me restless and I needed to punish her.  I asked my brother to bring in his friends to kidnap  the woman and we agreed that I would be on ground when she will be kidnapped.
“I did what they wanted and on the day she was kidnapped, I was at her house and we were both abducted and taken to a forest in Omuma village.  My gang members demanded N1.5m from her brothers, but they ended up paying us N300, 000.”
Chinindu, however, stated that he and his brother did not get any money from the proceeds of the operation.        
“The gang members who took the money refused to give my brother and me our share because they thought that the woman’s relative would pay more than they did.

“There were also nuns there, but he was the only one person they wanted to kidnap.”
Government spokesman Zakaria Abdourahamane told AFP: “The kidnappers came from Burkina Faso,” and added that troops “are scouring the area to find” the missionary.

The Society of African Missions (SMA) confirmed the abduction via the Mondo E Missione page on Facebook. It said it was “in round-the-clock contact” with a crisis cell at the Italian foreign ministry.
“There has been no claim by the kidnappers at present,” it said.
Niger, a large and poor country in West Africa, has become a target for recurring jihadist attacks from neighbouring Nigeria and especially in areas in the west that lie close to the border with Mali and Burkina Faso.
“The stretch to the north and west of Niamey are high-risk places,” former soldier turned security consultant Mohamed Ouagaya told AFP.
“It would really be suicide for Westerners to venture out there, no one can guarantee their security,” he said. “They need to go with a security escort …. and need to seek official protection.”
A German humanitarian worker was kidnapped in the same region of Tillaberi in April. In October 2016, an American aid worker was seized farther north. Security officials believe that they have been taken to northern Mali as hostages.        
Niger is a predominantly Muslim country, where between one and two per cent of the inhabitants are Christians in a population of about 20 million.
The Torodi region, where Maccalli was seized, has the largest concentration of Christians in the country."
6th September 2018,"Militants kill soldiers, kidnap scores of elders","Officials on Thursday said gunmen from Somalia’s Al Shabaab group killed six people including at least four soldiers in the streets of the capital, a day after the Islamist movement kidnapped scores of elders in a central region.
Police said the militants drove up to a tuk-tuk vehicle carrying the soldiers in Mogadishu’s Karan district and opened fire, killing all four of them on Tuesday.
“We heard the gunfire and we rushed to the scene but … the killers escaped,” police captain Farah Aden told Reuters.

He said Al Shabaab fighters also shot two people dead in the Wardigley district in the heart of the city.
The militants said the two were an officer and his bodyguard, in a statement claiming responsibility for both attacks.
Abdiasis Musab, al Shabaab’s military operations spokesman, said the militants also set off a car bomb that seriously injured a man working for the finance ministry.      
There was no immediate comment from the authorities.
Al Shabaab, which is fighting to impose its form of Islam and topple the Western-backed government , has launched regular guerrilla attacks across the country since the army backed by African peacekeepers pushed it out of the capital in 2011.
Officials said, on Monday, the group kidnapped more than 60 elders from Galgadud, in the central, semi-autonomous state of Galmudug.

Al Shabaab said it took the local leaders because their sub-clan had refused to pay full compensation for five people killed from another clan.
“We do not want the two clans to fight again,” said Abdullahi Abu Khalid, named as al Shabaab’s governor for Galgadud.
The militant group has kept up a presence in remote parts of Somalia, many of them already riven by years of ethnic rivalries and blood feuds.
Some clans are seen as linked to the militants, others to the government.        
Galmudug’s president, Ahmed  Haaf, said the militants had kidnapped 62 elders in a bid to destabilise his region.
“They will either kill them or order them to spread chaos,” he said.
He accused the central government in Mogadishu of not giving enough resources or troops to protect the region.
Somalia has been gripped by violence and lawlessness since dictator Siad Barre was toppled in 1991.

The whereabouts of a four-year-old Nursery 2 pupil, Chidogam Wike, is shrouded in mystery, three weeks after he was abducted in his parents’ compound on Ekani Avenue, Mile 4, Wimpy, Port Harcourt, Rivers State.
The kid was said to be playing with other children on the premises when a stranger lured on the pretext to buy him a toy.
Saturday PUNCH gathered that his parents had left him and his six-year-old brother behind while they attended a burial in the neighborhood on Saturday, July 7, 2018 around 12pm.
 
They were at the event when they received the news of their son’s abduction, which made them to rush back home.
Chidogam’s mother, Blessing Wike, said after a search around the community yielded no result, the case was reported to the police.
She said, “He is my second child. He and his brother were playing outside with other children when my husband I went for the burial. We were at the funeral when a neighbour called me that they could not find Chidogam.  I learnt one man wearing a Fez cap abducted him while he (the abductor) was playing with the children with toys. We have been looking for him since then.      
“I believe the man used charms because my son doesn’t follow people like that. We have reported to the police and done the necessary things. We are hoping in God to reunite him with us in a miraculous way.

16th June 2018,Kidnappers abduct three traders in Calabar,"Mudiaga Affe, Calabar
At least three traders have been kidnapped in Calabar, Cross River State, in the last four days.
Southern City News learnt on Friday that the kidnap is coming barely one month after two pupils were reportedly abducted from a public school in the Ikot-Effanga area of Calabar.
A Calabar resident, Mr. Adisa Ojo, said one of the kidnapped businessmen identified as Justin, was abducted at about 8pm on Monday at Palm Street in Calabar-South and taken to an unknown destination.
 
He said that another businessman, whose name was given as Nwadike, was kidnapped at about 9pm of the same day in the Ikot-Ansa area of the state.
He said, “Justine is 47. He is a native of Ukanafun in Akwa Ibom State and deals on cosmetics product at the Akpabuyo Market, while Nwadike (41), is a building contractor who shuttles between Imo and Cross River states.”
An eyewitness, Ogbonnia Udehi, said the third kidnap victim identified as Lumba is an auto mechanic, who was abducted at about 5pm in his workshop in Calabar on Wednesday.      
“Lumba is from Ohafia in Abia State. He was whisked away from his workshop at the Goldie Cemetery area of Calabar Municipality on Wednesday. The hoodlums came in at about 5pm on that fateful day and jumped through the fence into the premises.
“On sighting the gang, one of his boys took to his heels and while Lumba attempted to escape, the kidnappers swooped on him and whisked him into a waiting car  before zooming off. The kidnappers shot into the air to scare residents away while their victim cried for help,” he said.
A family source, who craved anonymity, said the kidnapers had yet to make contact with Lumba’s relatives.  Related News   Three arrested for killing Philippine governor  Zamfara boy kidnaps mother, collects N30m ransom  Police nab suspected criminal tricycle operator   
The source further said it was unusual for kidnappers to keep their victim for long without opening contact to demand for ransom.
However, a family member of Nwadike, who preferred not to be mentioned, said, “The abductors of my brother have called and demanded for N20m as ransom. But I pleaded with them that we do not have that kind of money.
“Well, we have not reported to the security operatives because they warned that if we do, they would kill him and we would still pay the ransom. So, we are in a dilemma and don’t know what to do. We are still begging the people to let go for his health sake.”
Reacting to the development, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hafiz Inuwa, said the situation has become the trend for families of most kidnapped victims who hardly report such incidents, adding that the situation was difficult for the police to intervene.        
He, however, said that the command has arrested three notorious criminals who have been terrorising Calabar-South, adding that they would soon be prosecuted.

He noted that the conference, which is being planned for Abuja in March, would bring together officials from the NMA, the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria and the Medical and Health Workers Union.

Udoessien was said to have been whisked away from his palace by the assailants after a fierce gun battle with security agents drafted to the area by the state government to provide security in the volatile area.
It was learnt that the monarch is a brother-in-law to a former Head of Civil Service in Akwa Ibom State.
 
A resident of the area, who identified himself only as Eno, told Southern City News that the monarch, a retired primary school headmaster and former chairman, Nigeria Union of Teachers in the area, might have been abducted because of his stance against cultism.

26th February 2018,Cameroon official kidnapped in restive northwest,"An administrative official was snatched over the weekend from one of Cameroon’s restive English-speaking regions in the second such kidnapping in a fortnight, state media reported on Monday.
The man was taken by armed men near Batibo, which lies 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of the city of Bamenda, and the same area from which another local official was taken on February 11.
“The regional representative for social affairs for the northwest region has been missing since Saturday. He was taken while in his car in the Batibo area by armed attackers,” Cameroon Radio Television (CrTV) said.
Regional police officials confirmed the kidnapping to CrTV, saying they had recovered his burnt-out vehicle.
 
The abduction was claimed on social media by the so-called Ambazonia Defence Forces (ADF), an armed group of English-speaking separatists from a self-proclaimed republic independent from the majority French-speaking country.
The ADF, headed by firebrand former student trade unionist Lucas Cho Ayaba, also snatched Namata Diteng, deputy head of the Batibo district earlier this month.  Related News   Canada commends peace moves in Cameroon  Onana releases statement after leaving Cameroon camp  W'Cup: Cameroon hold Serbia in dramatic 3-3 draw   
Dozens of people have been killed since October in Cameroon’s two restive anglophone regions following a violent government crackdown on protests against the mainly French-speaking government.      
The situation worsened at the end of January when 47 separatists, including Sisiku Ayuk Tabe, one of their leaders, were arrested in Nigeria, which sent them back to Cameroon, prompting a fresh wave of violence.
Aside from targeting police and soldiers, some separatist groups appear to be turning to kidnapping, as well as threatening French firms located in English-speaking areas.
Anglophones account for about a fifth of the west African country’s 23 million population.
On Thursday, a presidential decree paved the way for the creation of a fifth military subdivision which will oversee western Cameroon and be based in Bamenda.

7th February 2018,Tenant kidnaps landlady’s kids in Ondo,"A female tenant has reportedly kidnapped the two children of her landlady, seven days after she packed into the house in Okedogbon, in the Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State.
The two victims were identified as Ayomide Olamilekan (six months old) and Blessing Olamilekan (two years old).
A source said the female tenant and a man, suspected to be her husband, rented a room apartment from the mother of the children, Mrs. Abimbola Olamilekan, and paid for six months’ rent.
The source said the woman did not have any information about the tenant until the time she absconded with her kids on Tuesday, January 30, 2018.
 
On the day, the source said the mother of the victims was washing clothes at the backyard when the tenant offered to assist in taking care of the children, who were disturbing their mother. She took the kids away and never returned.

6th February 2018,"Gunmen kidnap DELSU lecturer, demand N20m ransom","Theophilus Onojeghen, Warri
Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have abducted a senior lecturer at the Delta State University, Abraka, Dr Boniface Anyanwu, and a son of one of his colleagues.
Anyanwu and the son of Prof. Augustine Nwachukwu were kidnapped on Saturday night at his residence in Obiaruku near Abraka, Delta State.
Our correspondent gathered that the kidnapped lecturer, believed to be living with a respiratory ailment known as Asthma, was forced into his  Toyota Camry car and whisked away to an unknown destination by the kidnappers.
 
Another lecturer at the university, who confirmed the development to our correspondent on Monday, said the hoodlums had contacted families of the victims and demanded N20m as ransom for both of them.
 The lecturer, on condition of anonymity, said that members of the university community were worried about their kidnapped colleague’s health since his abductors refused to allow him to take his drugs along.
The DELSU chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, in a statement signed by the Chairman and Secretary, Prof. Abel Diakparomre and Dr. Emmanuel Ufuophu-Biri, respectively, and made available to our correspondent on Monday, condemned the incident and appealed to the kidnappers to release their colleague and Prof. Nwachukwu’s son.      
 The statement reads in part, “The latest of these incidents is the kidnap of one of our lecturers, Dr. Boniface Anyanwu, a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Theatre Arts and Mr. Nnamdi Nwachukwu, son of another lecturer (Prof. Austin Nwachukwu of the Department of Human Kinetics and Health Education) who live at Obiaruku (a neighbouring community to Abraka). This incident occurred at about 3.00 am on Saturday, February 03, 2018.
 “The kidnap victims were taken away in the booth of Dr. Boniface Anyanwu’s car. The kidnappers have since made contact with the families of the kidnap victims demanding N10m ransom for the release of each of the victims. This is totally unacceptable.
“The kidnap of lecturers, and/or members of their family, is not only unacceptable, it is also bizarre and primitive. Academics, all over the world, are the springboard of society’s growth and development. This is so because of their role in imparting knowledge to persons who later become builders of societies. A society that has no respect for intellectual resource is destined for doom and damnation.”  Related News   Gunmen allegedly attack Delta PDP gov candidate’s convoy  UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Gunmen kill 400-level UNIBEN student   
ASUU also noted in the statement that DELSU lecturers had become endangered species in the hands of kidnappers. It called on the Delta State Government and security agencies to rise up to the safety of its members.
The statement added, “It is on record that Nigerian lecturers are among the most sought after intellectuals in the world. Many of them have, however, chosen to remain in Nigeria to contribute their quota to the reinventing and regeneration of our society despite the not very conducive environment in which they work and the lean wages.
“To have hoodlums wanting to squeeze them further through kidnap is crossing the threshold. It is pathetic that the extremely patriotic ones who have chosen to stay behind to help build the nation are being picked for ransom by criminally-minded persons and groups. The solution to this lies squarely with government.
“ASUU-DELSU demands that Dr. Boniface Anyanwu and Mr. Nnamdi Nwachukwu be rescued immediately from their abductors or released by the kidnappers without harm and unconditionally immediately,”        
When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the Delta State Police Command, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, confirmed the abduction of the lecturer and his colleague’s son.
Aniamaka said the police had already launched a manhunt for the kidnappers and he gave the assurance that the victims would be rescued unhurt.

10th January 2018,Kidnappers abduct another doctor in Calabar,"Mudiaga Affe, Calabar
A Senior Registrar in the Department of Paediatrics, University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Dr. Emem Udoh, has been abducted by unknown gunmen while on duty in Calabar, Cross River State.
This came barely two days after another medical practitioner with the Cross River State College of Education Medical Centre in the Akamkpa Local Government Area, Dr. Usang Ekanem, was released following his abduction on December 26, 2017.
There are indications that members of the state chapter of the Nigeria Medical Association may embark on an indefinite strike starting from Wednesday (today) in protest against the incessant abduction of their colleagues.
 
The Public Relations Officer of the state branch of NMA, Dr. Ernest Ochang, told Southern City News on Tuesday that Udoh was abducted at gunpoint on Monday night when she was coming back from an extended duty.
He said, “This is to inform the general public, particularly those resident in Cross River State that another medical doctor was kidnapped last night, January 8, 2018. This is coming after Dr. Usang Ekanem was suddenly released after we threatened a sit at home action.
“The young doctor was coming back from an extended duty of caring for children which is her passion and had to work beyond her schedule due to the few hands available in her unit.      
“We wish to inform Cross Riverians that this is one too many and a direct affront on our corporate existence. We took an oath to save lives and that much we must do. We pay tax and desire to live peacefully in the society.
“This targeted attack on us is unexplainable. What is more worrisome is the quietness of government whose responsibility is to provide security for its citizens. It is our collective resolve to call government to act through whatever means that is at our disposal.”  Related News   Kidnapped Ogun journalist rescued in Lagos after gun battle  Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi  Three arrested for killing Philippine governor   
Meanwhile, the state NMA has called on the state government to immediately declare a state of emergency on security over the incessant kidnapping of its members in the state.
In a communiqué jointly signed by the state Chairman of the NMA, Dr. Effiong Mkpanam, and the Secretary, Dr. Ikechukwu Ukweh, the association expressed dissatisfaction with the incessant attacks on its members in the state.
“It is noteworthy that in 2017, within the state capital alone, five doctors and three of their family members were kidnapped at various locations. We have noticed with utter dismay and drawn the attention of the authorities to an upsurge in the cases of targeted kidnapping of medical practitioners.
“We have also observed with dismay, a dangerous trend in which the security and lives of doctors is being threatened by some disgruntled members of the society, while the state authorities and security agencies stand aloof and complacent at the very least.
“We wish to remind the state government that it is her duty to provide adequate security for its citizens. The state government should, as a matter of urgency, declare a state of emergency on security in Cross River,” it stated.        
The association warned that it would withdraw all medical services without any notice anytime a doctor or dependants were taken captive.

5th January 2018,"Man kidnapped, forced to marry at gunpoint","Allegations a young engineer was kidnapped and made to marry at gunpoint are being investigated by police in one of India’s poorest states, which has a history of forced marriage of men.
Video footage apparently showing Vinod Kumar being forced to go through with a wedding by his bride’s family sparked the probe, police in the eastern state of Bihar said Friday.
‘Pakadua Vivah’ (forced marriage) is a practice specific to Bihar and surrounding areas, and is mainly carried out by poor families who cannot afford a dowry — still a widespread expectation in India.
A video circulated on social media shows the engineer being manhandled and forced to dress for the wedding as he pleads for freedom.
 
“We are only performing your wedding, not hanging you,” one man is heard to shout as Kumar begs to be released.
Another video shows Kumar sitting beside his bride crying while a woman, apparently an in-law, tries to console him.
Lalan Mohan Prasad, a local officer, told AFP police had contacted Kumar and offered their help but he had not formally complained.        Related News   Two Indian military jets crash, pilot killed  Indian boss allegedly drugs, rapes Delta teenager  India to replace 'colonial' naval flag   
Local media quoted the engineer as saying one of the bride’s relatives had pointed a pistol at him after they met at a mutual friend’s wedding and ordered him to marry her.
Since the incident, he has reportedly escaped and returned to his home in neighbouring Jharkhand state.
Bihar has a long-held reputation for lawlessness and gang violence, with families thought to enlist organised criminals to help them carry out abductions and forced marriages.
Local social scientist Saibal Gupta said such marriages enjoyed widespread acceptance and tended to endure, given the stigma of divorce.
“The frequency of such kidnappings has come down, but certainly not stopped. Poverty is still rampant,” he told AFP.
Official figures show police received nearly 3,000 complaints of groom kidnapping in 2016. None of the marriages were annulled.

27th December 2017,Vietnam oil exec 'kidnapped' from Germany to face trial,"A former Vietnamese official allegedly kidnapped from Germany will go on trial in Hanoi in January on corruption charges, officials said Wednesday, a high-profile case that could see the ex-oil executive put to death.
Vietnam’s communist government has jailed or arrested scores of former officials, bankers and state executives this year as part of a sweeping anti-corruption crackdown that some observers say is driven by political infighting.
But Trinh Xuan Thanh’s brazen Cold War-style kidnapping from a Berlin park by Vietnamese security agents in July stunned many inside and outside the one-party state, sparking a diplomatic dust-up that Germany called a “scandalous violation” of its sovereignty.
Hanoi had sought Thanh, the former head of state-run PetroVietnam Construction (PVC), for mismanagement and embezzlement causing massive losses.
 
Vietnamese officials said he returned home voluntarily to face the charges.
But German authorities said he was kidnapped on their soil, where he had sought asylum.
Thanh will face trial on January 8, alongside the former head of PetroVietnam and ex-politburo member Dinh La Thang, a court clerk told AFP.      
As head of PetroVietnam, Thang allegedly carved out a deal with Thanh — then chairman of the construction subsidiary of PetroVietnam — to build a thermal power plant.
The deal allegedly caused losses of $5.2 million for the state.
Twenty others also face charges in the case.  Related News   German schoolgirls confess to fatal stabbing of 12-year-old  How a German war film disarmed Oscar voters despite woes at home  Ex-Super Eagles coach, Troussier, set for Vietnam role   
Officials said the defendants “were mostly key leaders in important economic organisations, trusted by the state and the people to manage state capital”, according to the indictment cited by the official Vietnam News Agency.
Thang and Thanh face 20 years in jail for mismanagement, while the former PVC head Thanh faces an additional charge of embezzlement, which carries the death penalty.
Officials had earlier accused Thanh of causing losses worth $150 million, which he could still face in a separate trial.
Thanh appears to have been a marked man ever since he was spotted driving a flashy Lexus car with government plates while serving as deputy head of southern Hau Giang province.        
The men are the most prominent officials to face corruption charges as part of Hanoi’s massive crackdown that has already seen one senior banker sentenced to death and scores of others face stiff jail terms.
Observers say the anti-corruption sweep, which echoes a graft crackdown in Communist China, is being led by a conservative leadership in place since last year.
Many believe it is as much about cleaning up Vietnam’s corrupted ranks as it is about weeding out political enemies aligned with the former leadership.
Vietnam has been ranked 113 out of 176 on the corruption index by Transparency International, worse than its Southeast Asian neighbours Thailand, the Philippines and Myanmar.

The Kogi State police spokesman, William Aya, however, said the command did not record any case of kidnapping.
He said, “We did not record any case of abduction in Kogi. Somebody called me and said he (Arise) was abducted on his way from Ekiti State. Kogi State shares boundaries with Edo and Ondo states. At times, people would call us that there is abduction in Kogi, but when we investigate, we will discover it is Edo.”

One of six suspected kidnappers, Abubakar Tambaya, who was paraded by the Kwara State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Lawan Ado, said he went into kidnapping with his gang to become wealthy.
He, however, claimed that he was co-opted by his accomplices into kidnapping.
The 29-year-old Oro-Ago, Ifelodun Local Government Area of Kwara State indigene said he regretted his action.
 
The other suspects are Majuma Shehu, Mamman Lawal, Usman Umar, Babuga Umar and Abubakar Juli.
Tambaya said, “These people introduced me to it. They carried the Alhaji and took him into the bush. They said they would kill him if he did not give them money. I told them that they should not do that. We were looking for money. We wanted to be wealthy.”
The police boss said on November 7, at about 7am, the command received a report at the Ekiti Police Division that the victim, Usman Muhammadu, was missing.      
He stated that the message was subsequently relayed to all police formations in the state.
He said, “While searching for the missing person, there was another report that Muhammadu was actually kidnapped by gunmen and the family had paid a ransom of N500,000 for his release.

Eight days after they were kidnapped by gunmen, the families of an artisan and his cousin are still confused about their fate.
The victims – Olugbade Ibikunle and Rafiu Isiaka – were reportedly waylaid by the assailants on Akunu Road, Ondo State.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the scene of the incident was not far from a police post.
 
Operatives attached to the post were said to have engaged the kidnappers in a gun duel, but they escaped with their targets.
The captors were said to have contacted the families of the victims and demanded N10m ransom for their release.
Ibikunle’s younger sister, Folusho Adeyomoye, told our correspondent that the victims were travelling to Abuja from Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, with a lady last Monday when they ran into the gunmen.      
She said the lady was freed by the kidnappers, who whisked away the other victims.
She said, “My brother and cousin live in Ado Ekiti. They were travelling to Abuja from Ado Ekiti on Monday with a lady who is a family friend. They were going to see someone who promised to get them a job.
“According to the lady; when they got to Akunu Road, two kidnappers suddenly emerged from a bush and started shooting. They were forced to park. The road is bad and motorists usually slow down. So, the kidnappers took advantage of the bad road.
“The kidnappers released the lady and took away my brother and cousin. The lady said policemen at a police post near the scene of the kidnap exchanged them in a shootput, but they (the policemen) did not chase them.”  Related News   Gunmen allegedly attack Delta PDP gov candidate’s convoy  Kidnapped Ogun journalist rescued in Lagos after gun battle  Gunmen kill 400-level UNIBEN student   
Adeyomoye explained further that the car the victims were travelling in was abandoned at the scene, adding that the case was reported at the Ikare Police Division.
“The policemen there promised to look into the matter, but we have not heard any positive development from them. The kidnappers are asking for N10m. We pleaded with them to collect N3m. They rejected it and said they would not even accept N5m,” she said.
An uncle of the victims, Kayode Afolayan, said the kidnappers had threatened to “waste them” if they failed to raise the N10m ransom.        
The 70-year-old man said, “They left Ado Ekiti around 11.30am and got to that spot where they were abducted at about 1.30pm. We have met with the Ondo State Commissioner of Police. He said he had told his men to comb the bush.
“We have been negotiating with the kidnappers on the telephone. They said we were not serious. We heard gunshots and the cries of the victims.
“We have tried to raise N5m, but they are still insisting on N10m. There is no means to get that sum.”
The Ondo State Police Public Relations Officer, Femi Joseph, said the command was making efforts to rescue the captives.
He said, “We are still investigating and we have made some progress. But we don’t want to disclose anything for now.”

3rd November 2017,Gunmen kidnap four foreigners in Libya,"Four foreigners including three Turks working on the construction of a power plant have been abducted by armed men in southern Libya, a security official told AFP on Friday.
There was confusion over the nationality of the fourth, with a local security official saying he was a German engineer and the electricity company giving his nationality as South African.
“An armed group has abducted four workers of different nationalities (Turkish and South African)” in Ubari (1,000 kilometres (600 miles) south of Tripoli, the power company overseeing the project said in a statement.
It said the men were kidnapped at 11:30 local time (0930 GMT) and called for their immediate release.
 
The Turkish company Enka confirmed in a brief statement the kidnapping of three Turks, including two of its “employees who were in the country on a temporary mission”.
At the time, the men were “outside the construction zone,” it said.
Earlier, the local official said the four went missing on the road between the power station and the airport at Ubari.        Related News   Eight Libya-bound human trafficking victims rescued in Jigawa  Confed Cup: Rivers, Plateau storm Libya  FG evacuates 48 detained Nigerians, 69 others from Libya   
The Libyan company said it deplored the incident, and added that the “strategic” power station project was “in its final phase”.
The country has suffered from power shortages since the 2011 revolution that toppled long-time ruler Moamer Kadhafi.
Jihadist groups and militias have often targeted foreign workers and diplomatic missions in the lawlessness that has swept Libya ever since.
In June, gunmen briefly abducted seven members of the UN mission after an attack on their convoy.
Despite losing their Sirte stronghold in December last year, the Islamic State group remains active in Libya where it has since claimed several attacks.

The Lagos State Police Command has arrested the driver of a hotel operator on Victoria Island, William Olowoloju, for allegedly kidnapping his boss’ younger brother and the victim’s girlfriend.
Olowoloju and three others –Ayo Akinola, Segun Teluwo and one Akindamola – reportedly kidnapped the victims, Dumebi Azuka and Rebecca Omokoro, on Elegba Festival Drive, Oniru Private Estate, Victoria Island, at about 11.30pm on Saturday, October 21.
The lovers were driving out of the estate in a Ford Jeep when the abductors reportedly waylaid them at gunpoint and tied them up.
 
They were said to have driven the victims to their hideout in Agodo Alara village, Ogijo, Ogun State, and demanded N20m ransom from the hotelier, Edwin Azuka.
PUNCH Metro learnt that after the case was reported to the police, operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad trailed the suspects to the den.
The Acting Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Edgal Imohimi, who paraded the suspects on Tuesday, said the victims were rescued unhurt.      
He said, “Apart from the Jeep with number plate, LND 995 ES, one locally-made gun, a battle knife and four Automated Teller Machine cards, among others, were recovered from them.
“The suspects will soon be charged to court on completion of investigation.”
Also paraded were 50 suspected cult members, armed robbers, and drug peddlers arrested in the Ikorodu, Oshodi and Lagos Island areas of the state.
“The command once again appeals to the people of Lagos to be vigilant to make the state safe and secure. Whenever you see something, say something,” Imohimi added.
Speaking with our correspondent, Olowoloju, who hails from Ekiti State, said he had approached his boss to give him a N100,000 loan sometime in September, but the boss turned down his request.

The 37-year-old driver, who said he wanted to use the money for his in-law’s burial, explained that he felt disappointed and met with a friend, Akindamola, who advised him to kidnap Dumebi.
He said, “Akindamola said I would get the money if I kidnap my boss’ younger brother, Dumebi. I agreed with him, but I did not know how to go about it. He said he knew somebody who could make it work. He discussed with Segun and Ayo and they said there was no problem.        
“We did not hurt him and his girlfriend. I was not around when they (the gang members) demanded N20m. I went to buy drinks for the victims.”
Olowoloju added that Akindamola was released by the police on Monday.
The command, however, denied that Akindamola was released, saying he was a “soft target” the police trailed to arrest the gang members, adding that he was still at large.
Akinola, 22, an indigene of Akure, Ondo State, said the gang members spent a night with Williams on the estate to perfect their plan.
He said, “Williams invited us. He promised to give us money. We stopped the man’s car and pointed a gun at him. We drove him and the woman to Ogijo. We did not plan to kidnap the woman.
“We demanded N20m but he said he did not have money. He said he just invested his money in a business. In the night of the following day, we looked for a motorcycle and took them to a place where they could find their way back home.”
Teluwo, who owned the gun used for the operation, said, “I found the gun in an Ogun shrine on a construction site in Ikorodu. This is the first time I would participate in kidnapping.”

24th October 2017,Pirates kidnap six from German-owned ship in Port Harcourt,"Six crew members from a German-owned container ship, including the captain, have been kidnapped in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, maritime security analysts said.
The Sea Guardian consultancy said the Demeter “was attacked by pirates” at about 7:00 am (0600 GMT) on Saturday.
“Pirates boarded the ship, kidnapped six crew, including (the) master, chief officer, second officer, second engineer, bosun and cook,” it said on its website www.sguardian.com Monday.
Reports suggested the attack was carried out by eight pirates in a black speedboat, it added.
 
The Demeter had been travelling from the capital of Equatorial Guinea, Malabo, to the Liberian capital Monrovia at the time.
The Liberia-flagged vessel is owned by German shipping firm the Peter Doehle Group.
The MTI Network, a crisis communications firm that deals with incidents in the shipping industry said the attack happened as the ship entered the port of Onne.      
“All of the 12 remaining seafarers of the Demeter are safe and unhurt and the vessel has proceeded to safe waters,” it said in a statement.

18th October 2017,Four Britons kidnapped in Delta,"Suspected militants have kidnapped four British nationals in southern Nigeria, police and community leaders said on Wednesday.
The four had been providing “free medical care and religious activities” in the Burutu area of Delta state, said Chief Theo Fakama, from the local Enukorowa community.
Fakama said locals were “saddened” by the kidnapping as the victims had “brought succour to residents of the community for the past three years”.
The spokesman for Delta state police, Andrew Aniamaka, confirmed the kidnapping, which happened on October 13.
 
“The victims are of British nationality, two of whom are a couple, and have been rendering humanitarian services in the area for a while.
“But unfortunately, they didn’t let the authorities know of their presence in the area all this while.
“There is a militant group that has been operating in the area and we believe they are the ones behind the abduction.      
“Immediately the militants struck, they whisked the victims to the interior regions of the creek where we believe they are being held for the past five days.”  Related News   Gunmen allegedly attack Delta PDP gov candidate’s convoy  Delta police arrest three suspected armed robbers  Naval officers who invaded Delta police station now in detention - Spokesperson   
It was unclear whether any contact had been made with the kidnappers or the motive for the seizure, he added.
Kidnapping for ransom has long been a risk in Nigeria’s south, where high-profile individuals and their families are a frequent target for criminal gangs.
Victims are usually released after a few days once payment is made.
On October 14, the Vatican said an Italian priest was kidnapped by gunman just outside Benin City, which is the capital of Edo state and neighbours Delta state to the north.
Delta state commissioner of police Zanna Ibrahim told reporters in the state capital, Asaba, on Tuesday: “An anti-kidnapping team is already on the trail of the suspects.”
He suggested the abduction could be linked to a recent military operation against violent crime, which has seen an increase in troops in southern Nigeria.

30th August 2017,Boko Haram kidnaps nine in Borno,"Boko Haram jihadists have kidnapped nine people in two separate attacks in which one person was killed and two injured in Nigeria’s volatile northeast, vigilantes said Tuesday.
Five members of a family were kidnapped along a highway, 50 kilometres (30 miles) outside the city of Maiduguri as they waited for their car to be fixed on Tuesday, they said.
“Five members of a family were abducted today near the town of Dikwa by Boko Haram terrorists,” Babakura Kolo, a member of a militia fighting Boko Haram told AFP.
“The hostages included a woman, her three young daughters and sister,” he said.
 
Another militia member Ibrahim Liman gave a similar account, saying the victims were heading to Maiduguri under a military escort when their car broke down and was forced to stop.
“While the driver of the vehicle was trying to fix the car, Boko Haram terrorists appeared from the bush and seized them,” Liman said.
He said the driver however managed to escape.      
The 83-kilometre Maiduguri-Gubio highway reopened to motorists last December two years after it was closed following regular jihadist attacks.
The highway was reopened following military successes against Boko Haram which saw the jihadists losing territory.
However, the group continues to launch sporadic attacks on motorists without military escorts.
Tuesday’s attack came a day after four farmers were abducted by the Islamists near the town of Konduga, 38 kilometres from Maiduguri, said Kolo.  Related News   MNJTF arrests 900 suspected terrorist collaborators  29 Borno fishermen killed, nine injured in Boko Haram attack — Police  Suspected Boko Haram terrorists kill 29 fishermen in Borno   
He said one person was killed and two others injured in the incident.
The victims were among a group of 20 farmers from nearby Tori village who went to their farms “against military advice”, added militia member Musa Ari.
Konduga has been repeatedly targeted by Boko Haram Islamists.        
In May the jihadists killed six farmers as they worked in Amarwa village in the Konduga area.
Boko Haram’s eight-year insurgency has killed some 20,000 people and displaced at least 2.6 million others, sparking a dire humanitarian crisis in the region.
The displaced who live in camps and host communities rely on food handouts from aid agencies who have had to cut back assistance due to a cash crunch.
This has forced many displaced to return to their farms in liberated areas despite the risk of possible Boko Haram attacks.
On Saturday, around 15,000 people in Gubio displaced persons camp in Maiduguri went on a rampage over reduced food rations, aid workers told AFP.
The rioters were said to have vandalised five vehicles and pelted aid workers with stones.

Gunmen, on Monday night, intercepted a commercial bus along the Ndele-Elele area of East-West Road in the Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State and kidnapped 11 passengers.
The victims had boarded the bus at Rumuokoro at about 7pm in Port Harcourt and were travelling to Ndele, Elele and Ahoada before the incident happened about an hour later.
It was gathered that some of the passengers narrowly escaped the kidnap because they alighted before the vehicle got to its final destination (Ahoada).
 
One of the victims, Mr. Bright Welekwe, who escaped from the kidnappers a few hours after the abduction, spoke to The PUNCH in a telephone interview on Tuesday.
Welekwe said 18 persons boarded the bus at Rumuokoro, stating that three of the passengers alighted at Ndele before the incident occurred.
He added that the bus was intercepted by some gun-wielding men two minutes after leaving a police checkpoint, saying the 17 persons in the vehicle were forced into the bush at gunpoint.      
Welekwe said after the captives had walked a long distance into the bush, he sneaked into another area of the forest and escaped.  Related News   Kidnapped Ogun journalist rescued in Lagos after gun battle  Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi  Gunmen kidnap Taraba monarch’s wives, son

It did not take long; along the bush between Ndele and Elele Alimini, hoodlums ambushed us and took us inside the bush. Four other persons and I escaped before police personnel arrived at the scene.
“But I am sure they did not rescue the rest that night even with the help of soldiers. Police officers carried five of us to a place where we boarded another vehicle to our destinations.”
The state police commissioner, Mr. Zaki Ahmed, confirmed the incident on a radio programme, adding that the police had since swung into action with a view to rescuing the victims and apprehending the hoodlums without delay.

29th August 2017,"Gunmen ambush commercial bus in Rivers, kidnap 11","Gunmen abducted 11 people from a bus as they travelled close to Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers State, on Monday a passenger who escaped from the attack told AFP.
The region near Port Harcourt is a known hotspot for kidnappings by groups looking to receive ransom payoffs and was the scene of an abduction that saw 16 people snatched earlier this month.
“They ambushed us at about 9.00 pm… and after asking us to come out from the bus, they tried to take us inside the bush. But five of us escaped before police and military personnel arrived,” said Amiekro Princewill.
Security forces searched the area following the attack, according to another passenger who managed to escape the gunmen.
 
“They had gone far into the forest with the victims before the security operatives arrived,” said the escapee, Bright Belekwe.
“Hoodlums ambushed us and tried to take us inside the bush. I and four others escaped before police personnel arrived at the scene.”
The kidnapping is the third such incident in just two months.        Related News   Gunmen allegedly attack Delta PDP gov candidate’s convoy  UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Gunmen kill 400-level UNIBEN student   
Regional police commissioner Ahmed Zaki confirmed the kidnapping at a press conference at force headquarters in Port Harcourt, adding that efforts to locate the victims were ongoing.
“The incident is quite unfortunate and the police are on top of the situation in ensuring that the hoodlums are arrested and brought to book,” he said.
Kidnapping for ransom used to be confined to Nigeria’s oil-rich south, where criminal gangs would typically target expatriate workers.
But the practice has spread across the country as the economy has faltered with Control Risks consultancy warning that the phenomenon has become “entrenched” nationwide.
Nnamdi Obasi, a senior Nigeria researcher at the International Crisis Group, said poverty had made “anybody” a target and had led to a rise in “spontaneous” kidnappings.
Most victims are usually released unhurt after ransom money is paid.

Zeidan had returned to Libya in early August for the first time since his dismissal and was planning a Tripoli press conference to respond to his critics, according to Karam Khaled, a friend who accompanied him.
 
He said the former premier’s visit had been coordinated with Fayez al-Sarraj, premier in the country’s United Nations-backed Government of National Accord.
“It was the GNA that prepared the visit, including protocol at the airport and the hotel reservation,” Khaled said.
He said an armed group’s first attempt to seize Zeidan on August 12 was foiled by hotel guards.      
He said the gunmen were from the GNA-linked Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade, a militia of former rebels from the NATO-backed 2011 uprising that led to the overthrow and killing of longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi.
“Gunmen from the same group returned the next day and we were obliged to hand them Zeidan,” Khaled said.  Related News   Eight Libya-bound human trafficking victims rescued in Jigawa  Confed Cup: Rivers, Plateau storm Libya  FG evacuates 48 detained Nigerians, 69 others from Libya   
“Since then, we have had no information on where he is being held or his condition,” he said, criticising the “silence” of the unity government.
The ex-prime minister’s son Zeidan Zeidan said the family had no news of his father’s whereabouts.
“We have nothing so far,” he said by phone from the United Arab Emirates, where he lives.
He said his father’s lawyer had told him no court cases had been brought against the former premier.
“This was indeed a kidnapping and not an arrest,” he said, adding that the family is worried for the health of his father, who is 67.        
In October 2013, gunmen seized the then premier from Tripoli’s luxury Corinthia Hotel, but he was released after several hours.
Since Kadhafi’s fall, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have been obliged to depend on rival militias that are battling for control of the North African country.

There was panic among travellers in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, on Monday when reports filtered in that some hoodlums suspected to be kidnappers had abducted five passengers, including the driver of a bus belonging to God is Good Motors.
The occupants of the vehicle were said to be Lagos-bound from Port Harcourt before they were waylaid and taken to an unknown destination by their gun-wielding captors.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the incident happened at about 7.20am in Elibrada community along the East-West Road, in the Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State.
 
Sources said the hoodlums had blocked the road with tree trunks and rushed out immediately the bus slowed down.
PUNCH Metro gathered that the kidnappers pointed guns at the bus and ordered the passengers to come out before marching them into a bush.
A community leader, who did not want to be identified, said the kidnappers also shot continously into the air and at the bus.      
The source added that no person was found dead in the abandoned vehicle after the incident.
However, an official of the transport company, who declined comment on the development, said the management of the firm had moved to the scene of the incident to confirm the story.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the booking of passengers for the Tuesday’s journey at the Aba Road office of the transport firm was still ongoing despite the incident.
But the Rivers State Police Command, who confirmed the incident to one of our correspondents, said it had rescued three among the passengers.

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Nnamdi Omoni, said through a text message that the three victims were rescued at the risk of a shootout between security operatives and the kidnappers.
Omoni denied that all the passengers were abducted, saying those kidnapped were five before three were rescued.
“Five passengers were kidnapped and three of them have been rescued, remaining two. We fought hard to rescue them at the risk of a gun battle,” the text message indicated.        
However, several calls to get the police PRO to speak on where the victims were rescued and whether the bus had been recovered were not answered.
It was also learnt that no contact had been established between the suspected kidnappers and any of the victims’ relatives as of the time of filing this report.
A bus driver, who simply gave his name as Nkeme, told PUNCH Metro that he and some of his colleagues were always afraid whenever they got to some points along the East-West Road in Emohua while travelling.
“We need the police to be in those places. Whenever we are travelling, we are always afraid of the activities of kidnappers and armed robbers,” he said.

7th August 2017,Gunmen kidnap Lagos-bound passengers in Rivers,"Gunmen abducted 16 people from a passenger bus near southern Nigeria’s oil city of Port Harcourt on Monday, witnesses told AFP.
“They blocked the road and opened fire on the bus as it approached the Emohua area, thereby forcing the driver to a stop,” said witness Tamuno George.
“There were 16 people including the driver.”
A staff member of the company which operated the bus said the gunmen then marched the passengers into the bush.
 
“The hoodlums accosted the bus…. ordered the passengers and driver out of the vehicle and marched them into the bush,” the worker, who did not want to be identified, told AFP.
Police in Rivers state confirmed the incident, adding that a manhunt had been launched for the gunmen.
“The command is currently analysing the information it received from witnesses over the incident,” said state police spokeswoman Nnamdi Omoni.

“Concerted efforts are already on to apprehend the hoodlums.”
Kidnapping for ransom used to be common in Nigeria’s oil-rich south, where criminal gangs singled out the wealthy and expatriate workers in targeted or opportunistic attacks.
But it has gradually spread across the country as its oil-dependent economy has imploded, to the extent that the Control Risks consultancy has said kidnapping for ransom is now “entrenched” countrywide.
Nnamdi Obasi, senior Nigeria researcher at the International Crisis Group, said poverty had made “anybody” a target and had led to a rise in “spontaneous” kidnappings.

7th August 2017,"Fulani herdsmen kidnap ECWA Director, demand N100m ransom","Friday Olokor, Jos
Apprehension has taken over the National Headquarters of Evangelical Church Winning All (International) following the abduction of its Christian Education Director, Rev. Jen Moses, by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen.
Although the details of the incident were still sketchy, Northern City News learnt that he was kidnapped on Friday evening between Jere and Bwari on the outskirts of the Federal Capital Territory while on an official meeting.
During the attack, his driver was shot and has been reportedly receiving treatment in Bwari hospital in Abuja, while the kidnappers have placed a call on the church and family members demanding N100m ransom.
 
The spokesperson of the FCT Police Command, Anjuguri Manzah, said he had yet to receive any report on the kidnap.
“We have not received any report of such an incident. Yes, at that end, Bwari is a very big point and the biggest town. So, oftentimes, people describe everywhere as Bwari which shares boundary with different states”, he stated.
But when contacted, the General Secretary of ECWA, Yunusa Nmadu, confirmed the abduction to Northern City News, saying the bandits had made a demand of N100m ransom.      
He said, “The kidnappers were seven Fulani boys; they were below 20 years. The incident happened on Friday night between 8 and 9pm. Reverend Jen Moses was on his way from Jos to Abuja around Jere-Bwari Road. The kidnappers are demanding N100m ransom.  Related News   Kidnapped Ogun journalist rescued in Lagos after gun battle  Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi  Gunmen kidnap Taraba monarch’s wives, son   
“The vehicle in which he was traveling was also seen on the checkpoint because his driver had a gunshot. The driver was advised to obtain police report before he was treated. I am aware that the incident was reported in a police station somewhere in Bwari Area Council.
“We will rather keep what we have been doing now to ourselves so that we don’t jeopardise investigation and efforts being made to secure his release. We will speak to the press after securing his release.”
Northern City News had reported that on May 10, armed robbers suspected to be Fulani herdsmen had attacked travellers on the ever-busy Jos-Keffi Expressway, carting away mobile phones and money from them.
The robbery took place at about 10am on the Expressway close to a village called Barde, after Gidan Waya in Kaduna State, a few kilometres from Jos, Plateau state capital.
The robbers, numbering about ten, with five of them wielding dangerous weapons, including guns and machetes, came from the bush, stopped vehicles and ordered passengers to lie face-down.

17th July 2017,Tribal militia kidnap two priests in DR Congo,"Tribal militia forces have kidnapped two Roman Catholic priests in the troubled North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, officials said Monday.
Kidnappings are frequent in this eastern part of the DRC, related to communal conflict between the Nande and Hunde tribes on one hand and ethnic Hutus on the other. The two priests come from the Nande ethnic group.
“The curate Charles Kipasa and the vicar Jean-Pierre Akili … were taken overnight by Mai-Mai who led them off to the mountains. They also took two vehicles and two motorbikes,” Bishop Paluku Sikuli of the Beni-Butembo region told AFP.
“I confirm the kidnapping of two priests from the Catholic parish of Bunyuka by unknown armed persons,” the administrator of the province’s northern Beni district, Amisi Kalonda, said. “Our defence and security services are working to find them.”
 
“The kidnappers abandoned the two vehicles that were transporting them,” Kalonda added.
In 2012, three priests were abducted near Beni by Ugandan rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces, who have been driven out of neighbouring Uganda and are notorious for their cruelty. There has been no word of them since.  Related News   Congolese group protests killings, seeks France help  Train derails in DR Congo, kills seven  Scores die in DR Congo train accident   
Local communities like the Nande, Hunde and Kobo, who form the majority population in North Kivu, regard Hutus as foreigners originating in neighbouring Rwanda. Rivalry over land and resources date back for generations.      
The Mai-Mai first emerged as community self-defence groups formed on a mainly ethnic basis.
During the Second Congo War (1998-2003), many of these groups were armed by the distant Kinshasa authorities to help battle invading Ugandans and Rwandans.
Rich in precious minerals, the east of the DRC has been unstable for 20 years. Several dozen local and foreign armed groups stand accused of serious rights abuses against civilians, such as rape, killings and abductions.

FOURTEEN passengers travelling from Warri in Delta State to Port-Harcourt, Rivers State, through one of the popular transport companies (name withheld) have been allegedly kidnapped by gunmen at the Rumoji near Port-Harcourt in Rivers State.
The incident which security sources told our correspondent occurred on Monday has led to serious apprehension among residents living in communities situated along the highway as the hoodlums continue to lay siege to the passengers including the bus driver.
It was gathered that the arms wielding bandits waylaid the bus and dragged all occupants into a nearby bush from where they were whisked to an unknown destination.
 
The PUNCH reliably gathered that the hoodlums who had contacted the family of the victims are demanding one million naira on each of the passengers before they could be released.
A source at the travelling company while confirming the incident said the gunmen had reduced the ransom to N100, 000 each for the travellers after the victims’ families told them they cannot raise the one million naira ransom the abductors were earlier demanding.
Giving details of the incident, one of the security sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said, “The 14-seater bus was travelling to Port-Harcourt when heavily armed men waylaid the bus and kidnapped all occupants including the driver.

It was a bit unbelievable until our sister security agency recovered the bus from where the incident happened around Ughelli/Port-Harcourt section of the road. The hoodlums have also contacted the families of the victim. Security has been beefed in the area.”
Another security source added, “Though the hoodlums are in contact with the bus company and have reduced the ransom for the release of the driver and the passengers to N100, 000, we and other sister security agencies are on the trail of the hoodlums and would do everything to ensure that the victims are released unhurt.”

24th June 2017,"How Evans kidnapped, killed my 86-year-old father after collecting N15m – Ex-Super Eagles player","Kunle Falayi
When news broke that suspected notorious kidnap kingpin, Chukwudubem Onwuamadike (AKA Evans) had been arrested in Lagos by the police on June 10, many people celebrated the security agencies that made it happen.
But far less known was the celebration it produced in the compound of the Iloenyosi family of Abagana, Anambra State.
For this family, the news of Evans arrest was a personal victory.
 
It all began one early morning on November 25, 2013 when the patriarch of the family, Chief James Iloenyosi, was kidnapped on his way back from mass.
His son, Chikelue Iloenyosi, former Super Eagles player who played professional football in France and Turkey, has not been able to get over what happened to his father. He narrated the event that quickly became a game of hide and seek between criminals and the law enforcement agents.
He told Saturday PUNCH in an emotion-laden tone that his father, who was 86 at the time, was on his way back from their local Catholic church when three SUVs double-crossed him and whisked him away.      
He would never see his father alive again.
“When they took him away, they did not talk to us until after five days. They phoned my twin sister. She was sobbing when she called me that the kidnappers had made contact.
“When we the children gathered, my sister called the kidnappers again and they simply told us that they would call back. They did not call back until after another five days just to build our anxiety.”
The N50m ransom negotiation
According to Chikelue, with no idea what could be going on with his father, the kidnappers on the morning of the fifth day called to demand a ransom of N50m.
The routine of begging and pleading for the reduction of the ransom started at this point and after many days, they eventually reduced the ransom to N15m.
Chikelue said, “When we paid the N15m, my father was already dead and we did not know.        
“What made me upset was that despite how seriously we worked to get him back, my father did not come out of it alive.”
But upon payment of the ransom, the kidnappers said they were not releasing their victim until the family brought more money. But they never heard from the kidnappers again.
Breakthrough arrests four months later
However, after four months of investigation into the kidnap, said to have involved hundreds of policemen in Anambra State combing the forest at the time, security agencies got a break when a member of the gang that kidnapped Chikelue’s father, a suspect known as Nonso, was arrested along with three other members of his gang.
Chikelue said at the time, Evans was already a popular criminal well known to the State Anti-Robbery Squad of the Anambra State Police Command.
He was said to be a wanted robber known for hitting bullion vans.
“The SARS boss in Anambra told me at the time that any suspect arrested for any major crime always mentioned the name of Evans,” he said.      
According to him, the family had to involve a private investigator in the case at a point when there was no longer news about their father’s whereabouts months after the family paid the ransom.
In addition to this, he said a friend of his based in Israel helped to track his father’s line and traced it to a young lady, who said Nonso was his boyfriend.
Chikelue told Saturday PUNCH, “When we arrested the girl, she said Nonso only gave her the phone for safe-keeping, instructing her not to put it on. We started tracking Nonso. At a point, the current leader of the IRT, Abba Kyari, gave us 18 of his men to follow us to Cotonou, Benin Republic because our trace on Nonso’s line showed he was there.
“We got there and the police arrested a young man, who said he came to buy a car. He said the number was not his and that he only wanted to use it to call somebody in Nigeria. The police had to let him go when it was clear he knew nothing.
“Later we left the Cotonou guy. Again, our private tracker traced him to Lokoja, Kogi State.”
Evan’s gang member arrested in Lokoja
However, intelligence later suggested that Nonso was in Lokoja.  
According to him, he and other members of the gang were said to have relocated there immediately they shared the ransom because many security agencies were after the gang.
Chikelue said after identifying the hotel the suspect might be hiding in, some members of the SARS team in Kogi State moved in to make the arrest.
He said, “I was in Lokoja for two months with a private tracker before we arrested Nonso.
“When we got to the hotel with the police that day, we requested for the list of the people staying at the hotel. The hotel staff mentioned a “small boy” with his girlfriend in one of the rooms.
“We knocked on the door and the girlfriend came out. He said her boyfriend was in the bathroom. But I was hearing a sound inside. He was trying to escape through the window but SARS operatives were already stationed around the hotel.
“He eventually came out and said his name was Emmanuel. But I knew it was him right away because we had been able to obtain his photograph ahead.
“But because I did not want him to panic, I pretended it was not him and told the SARS operatives in his presence that the person we were looking for was an older man.      
“He relaxed and was going inside when I called him and said I wanted to ask him something. I dialled his phone number there and then when it rang, we took it and it showed the name ‘Kidnapper football’. The SARS operatives immediately pounced on him and handcuffed him.  Related News   Return €233,000 ransom, court orders Evans  Evans re-arraignment stalled over lawyer absence  Evans lawyer’s absence stalls re-arraignment   
“I asked Nonso if he knew me, he said he did not. I told him I was the footballer whose number he saved with that name. He then asked if I was ‘General’ – my alias – and I said yes.”
Saturday PUNCH learnt that as soon as Nonso was arrested, he became submissive.
He reportedly pleaded for his life, saying he would provide any information the police needed.
“He immediately told us that his leader was Evans. But he said there was no way we could get Evans because he had fled to Lagos after the completion of the operation. At this point, Nonso kept our hope alive. He said my father was still alive. He refused to give precise information,” Chikelue told our correspondent.
The ex-footballer said he was very hopeful at that point and believed he was indeed going to get his father back alive.
Nonso, who was transported back to Anambra in the company of SARS operatives later provided the police with Evans’ phone line, with which they started tracking him.        
When the police team got to Anambra with the suspect, he reportedly began to plead not to be taken to SARS headquarters in the state for fear of being tortured and killed. He said he was willing to give up all the necessary information.
Nonso told the police that Evans was always on the move after each operation.
Chikelue said, “We were calling Evans to pinpoint his location but it was all abortive. Nonso was later made to call another member of the gang called Awolowo to inform him that there was an operation.
“But Awolowo said he did not want to do any operation at the time because his wife had just put to bed. Nonso said Awolowo was part of Evans’ Asaba, Delta State group.”
Suspects refused to confess
The police later arrested Awolowo and two others.
For many days, these suspects were said to have kept mum.      
It was learnt that they refused to divulge any information about Evans, which the police suspected was owing to the fact that they had taken an oath.
In fact, one of the suspects, who was on the verge of confessing was said to have suddenly started acting like someone with a mental illness.
Even Nonso’s girlfriend who was also arrested was said to have refused to give any information that could implicate her boyfriend.
“The most shocking thing was that when the police interrogated Nonso, he said that if the SARS ever wanted peace in Anambra, they should kill the lady.  He said she was the one responsible for taking care of the gang and that she helped them buy drugs and collected ransom on their behalf,” Chikelue said.
But he said while all these were going on, his only concern was knowing his father’s whereabouts.
One day, while Chikelue was at the SARS office, he found a sudden ally in an armed robbery suspect called Onyeso, who was detained there.
Chikelue said, “He pulled me aside and said, ‘My brother, you are a good man because you always give money so that the police could buy us food when you come here’. He said he wanted to give me a privileged information.      
“He said if we wanted any result, we should take Awolowo to the backyard and tell the police to shoot their gun in the air as if they had killed him. He said the other one would start confessing because they had indeed taken an oath.
“When the police did this, Nonso started confessing when he was told Awolowo had been killed. He said he would take us to where my father was buried.
“We journeyed into the forest for three and half hours before we got to where they buried him. I broke down and my sister who was there at the time fainted.”
Saturday PUNCH learnt that the late Pa Iloenyosi was buried around Nneyi village in Umueri community.
But most heartbreaking was the information that the old man might have been starved or beaten to death.
When Nonso was asked how the old man died, he explained that it was the fault of those manning the hideout where Evans kept the man.
Pa Iloenyosi was said to have been stripped to his underwear, kept in a cold room and beaten regularly in order to put more pressure on his children.      
Chikelue said, “While we were negotiating for ransom, they would call and put the phone on speaker so I could hear how they beat him. My father would cry and beg me to find a way to ensure his freedom.
“We buried him few days after we found his body and started the search for Evans. One of the vital information Nonso gave us was that they were on their way to a robbery when they got information about my father and they diverted to Abagana to kidnap him. So, I was really particular about the arrest of Evans so that he could tell us who in our community gave them the information.”
Chikelue said he was the happiest man in the world the day he heard Evans had been arrested. But he said he was particularly upset when he read that Evans was begging for his life with the excuse that he had never killed a victim before.
“What Evans did to my family was the most painful thing anybody can experience. When I read he has been begging for sympathy, I just laughed. The death penalty for people like him is the only solution. Evans can never repent despite all the second chance he is begging for.”
Chikelue said the police were already aware of Evans connection to his father’s kidnap and murder and are taking it into account in the case against him.
Meanwhile, the Anambra State Police Command says it is liaising with its Lagos State counterpart on the records of Evans’ past crimes in the state.

5th June 2017,Kidnappers abduct Delta commissioner’s wife,"Ovie Okpare, Warri
Some gun-wielding kidnappers have abducted Mrs. Theresa Sakpra, the wife of the Delta State Commissioner for Special Duties, Chief Henry Sakpra.
The woman was whisked away around Ekete Inland Junction, along DSC Expressway, in the Udu Local Government Area of the state.
Sources told our correspondent that Theresa was abducted by the hoodlums on her way home from her shop at about 6.15pm last Thursday, after dropping one of her salesgirls along the expressway. She was said to have been taken to an unknown destination.
 
A political associate of the commissioner, who pleaded not to be identified, confirmed the incident.
“She was taken away in her car, but the vehicle was later recovered the following day along the Effurun/Ughelli end of the East-West Road,” he added.
It was not clear on Sunday if the abductors had contacted the Sakpra family for any ransom as efforts to speak with the husband were unsuccessful.      
Meanwhile, youths under the aegis of Udu Youth Council have appealed to the hoodlums to release the victim without further delay, describing the spate of kidnapping in the state as worrisome.  Related News   Three arrested for killing Philippine governor  Police nab suspected criminal tricycle operator  FG lists crimes prevalent in N’West, S’South, others   
The youths, in a statement by their President, Mr. Otito Yembra, and three others, stated that the abduction of Sakpra’s wife was not only a cowardly act, “but a desperate action from characters that seek to profit from their criminal conduct.”
The youths added that the act was also a sore reminder of the growing resurgence of criminality in Urhobo land and Udu in particular.
“We join friends, family and other well-meaning Nigerians in calling on the abductors of the respected Mrs. Theresa Sakpra to immediately release her unconditionally and unhurt. We are also calling on the security agencies to find Mrs. Theresa Sakpra without any delay,” the statement read in part.
The spokesman for the Delta State Police Command, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, declined to speak on the incident, but a senior police officer in the command confirmed the abduction of the commissioner’s wife.
Effort to speak to the state Commissioner of Police, Zanna Ibrahim, proved abortive as calls and text messages to his telephone line were neither picked nor replied to.

Adelani Adepegba and Godwin Isenyo
A member of the House of Representatives, Garba Umar- Durbunde, representing  Sumaila/Takai Constituency of Kano State, has been kidnapped in Kaduna.
The PUNCH gathered that Umar-Durbunde was kidnapped at Jere along the Kaduna-Abuja Road around 5pm on Tuesday on his way to Kano from the Federal Capital Territory.
 
 It could not be immediately ascertained if he was alone in the vehicle during the incident.
A member of the House, who pleaded anonymity, said the abductors had not contacted family members and friends of the lawmaker.
“He was kidnapped on his way to Kano from Abuja. His family and friends have not heard anything about him,” he said.      
A police source stated, “The lawmaker was on his way to Kano when he was abducted but details of the incident are sketchy. What I can confirm is that the police had launched a massive manhunt for the hoodlums who perpetrated the abduction and we are sure of rescuing the lawmaker soon and apprehending his captors subsequently.”
The Kaduna State Police Command spokesman, Aliyu Usman, confirmed the abduction of Umar-Durbunde by suspected hoodlums, but declined to speak further on efforts to rescue him.
“I can confirm the abduction of the lawmaker,” he told one of our correspondents on the telephone on Wednesday but declined to provide additional details.

The Presidency and the Governor of Kano State, Dr. Abdullahi  Ganduje, expressed shock over the kidnapping of the lawmaker.
The Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (House of Representatives), Mr. Abdulrahman Kawu, told The PUNCH that the incident was condemnable, calling on security operatives to ensure his release.
“This is a condemnable act; I have just heard about it. I am still expecting the details and it is shocking,” Kawu stated.
On his part, Ganduje condemned the kidnapping, saying it was unfortunate that such evil was carried out during the Ramadan.        
In a statement by the Kano State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Garba Muhammad, on behalf of the state government, the governor called on security agents to secure the release of the lawmaker.
 He stated, “Governor Ganduje, who was shocked by the news of the sad and unfortunate event, particularly at this holy month of Ramadan, condemned it in the strongest term as an act of wickedness perpetrated by evil and cold-hearted elements.
 “He therefore called on the police force and other security agencies to intensify effort to rescue the kidnapped lawmaker while also advising members of the public to be vigilante and security conscious at all times.

11th April 2017,Two Turkish nationals kidnapped in Akwa Ibom,"Gunmen have kidnapped two Turkish nationals from their hotel in southern Nigeria’s oil-rich Akwa Ibom state, police said Tuesday in the latest unrest to hit the restive Niger Delta.
“Two Turkish nationals working for a construction company in Onna local government area were abducted from their hotel rooms on Sunday,” state police spokesman Chukwu Okechukwu told AFP.
He said the men, who work for BKS Construction Company which is based in Onna, were seized by gunmen from a hotel in Eket, an industrial city which is home to Mobil, the Nigerian subsidiary of US oil giant Exxon.
He said efforts were under way to free the pair.
 
It was not immediately clear why they were kidnapped and so far no group has claimed responsibility.

5th April 2017,"Gunmen in police uniform kidnap corps member, three travellers","Afeez Hanafi
A member of the National Youth Service Corps, Becky Godfrey, and three other travellers were abducted on Monday by some gunmen.
The victims were reportedly on a bus travelling to Bayelsa State when the kidnappers lay in ambush for them on Okene-Auchi Road.
It was learnt that Becky, who is serving in the Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, was travelling back to her place of primary assignment to sign a clearance form for her monthly allowance when the incident happened.
 
PUNCH Metro gathered that one of the assailants, who was in a police uniform, had flagged down the bus. As the driver stopped, other members of the gang came out of a bush and seized the corps member.
They were said to have picked three other passengers, while other occupants, including the driver, were freed before the gunmen disappeared into the bush with their victims.
It was gathered that the driver reported the incident at the Okene Police Division.      
A few hours after the abduction, the assailants contacted Becky’s father, Braima Godfrey, on the phone, and demanded N5m in ransom.
Braima, who spoke with our correspondent on the telephone, said efforts to negotiate with the kidnappers were futile, adding that the police eventually rescued Becky and other victims around 12pm on Tuesday.
He said, “They said I should bring N5m. I bargained with them on Monday, but they did not agree. I called them more than 20 times, but they insisted on N5m. I called them again this morning (Tuesday), they were adamant.
“My daughter told me on the phone that some of her abductors wore masks and that three other passengers were kidnapped. She graduated last year from Auchi Polytechnic, Edo State, where she studied Marketing. She will finish her service in May.

“Around 12pm, my daughter and the three others were rescued and one of the suspects was arrested.”
Thirty-year-old Becky, who spoke to our correspondent on the phone shortly after she was rescued, described her experience in the kidnappers’ den as traumatic.        
She said was awoke all night without being given food, adding that the abductors offered them dirty water when they complained of thirst.
She said, “As we were travelling, an armed man in a police uniform stopped our bus. We were 11 on that bus. Our driver thought he was a policeman and stopped for him. He suddenly fired his gun and some men came out of the bush.
“They collected our money and phones and took four of us with them into the bush. Some of them were Fulani. They beat me up and forced me to disclose my father’s phone number.
“My experience in the bush was terrible. They didn’t give us any food. Later, they gave us dirty water to quench our thirst. The water was smelly. None of us drank it. I was the only female; the three other victims were males.”
The Kogi State Police Public Relations Officer, William Aya, said two persons were arrested and had been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department.
He said, “The Area Commander led a team to the bush and rescued the four victims. One of them is a corps member. We were able to arrest two suspects and efforts are ongoing to arrest fleeing members of the gang.”

A Lagos-based businessman, Benedict Kpaduwa, has been abducted by some gunmen at his hometown in Anara, in the Isiala Mbano Local Government Area of Imo State.
 Kpaduwa was a former Principal Manager, Finance and Accounts, at the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria.
PUNCH Metro learnt the victim was abducted around 9am on the premises of his firm, Mekcyn Investment.
 
Eyewitnesses told our correspondent that the armed men were  in a Hummer bus.
They reportedly trailed Kpaduwa to the premises of the firm and dragged him out of his Toyota Corolla after shooting repeatedly into the air to scare away his workers and passersby.
The victim, our correspondent gathered, had just returned home from Lagos when the incident happened.      
A source in the village, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Kpaduwa was kidnapped in the presence of his workers, who scampered to safety.

 The source said the villagers had reported the incident at the Anara Police Division at Idem, adding that the businessman was kidnapped close to his home.
“The gunmen shot repeatedly into the air. They went straight to their target and dragged him from his Toyota Corolla into their Hummer bus. They ordered a pastor of a nearby church, who came out on hearing gunshots, to lie down,” he said.
Another resident, who did not want to be identified, said he heard the sound of gunshots and ran to safety, only to be told afterwards that the 55-year-old businessman had been abducted.
A source in the village told our correspondent that the kidnappers had yet to contact the victim’s family.
 Text messages sent to the mobile phone of the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Andrew Enwerem, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, had yet to be replied to as of the time of filing this report.

3rd April 2017,"Farmer kidnaps female banker, seeks N10m ransom","Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja
A 24-year-old farmer, Sule Haruna, has been remanded in prison custody by a Lokoja Chief Magistrate’s Court over alleged kidnap of a female banker, Morayo Ogunleye, for N10m ransom.
Mr. Alhassan Husaini of Lokoja Chief Magistrate Court II who gave the remand order on arraignment of the accused on Monday in Lokoja said the two-count charge preferred against Haruna was not bailable.
”It is hereby ordered that the accused be remanded at the Federal Prisons, Koton-Karfe. Meanwhile, this case is adjourned to April 17, for mention,” the judge said.
 
The accused was charged with criminal conspiracy and kidnapping contrary to Section 97(1) of the Penal Code and sections 4(1) and 2 of the Kogi State Kidnapping and Other Related Offences (Prohibition) Law, 2015.
Earlier in his submission, the prosecuting police officer, Sgt. Adeboye Awoyale, told the court that the kidnap case was reported by one Sam Ayinigba of Zenith Bank, Lokoja, on November 15, 2016.
Awoyale said the Police Special Anti Robbery Squad received a distress call from Zenith Bank, Akure branch, that a senior staff of the bank, Morayo Abiodun Ogunleye, had been kidnapped.        Related News   UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Teenager, guardian in court for kidnapping children  Zamfara boy kidnaps mother, collects N30m ransom   
According to him, Ogunleye, who was travelling to Abuja on an official assignment in the company of her driver, was violently stopped at a spot between Osara and Irepeni on Okene-Lokoja highway by armed Fulani men.
The prosecutor further alleged that the Fulani men invaded the road and started shooting sporadically at her Hyundai Sonata vehicle and stopped them at gun point.
The hoodlums later kidnapped the banker and her driver and took them into the bush, only to later call Ogunleye’s relations to demand N10m ransom before they could release her.
Awoyale said the accused (Haruna) of Zaho Area, Lapai, Niger State, an alleged member of the kidnap gang, was later caught with the banker’s driving license, National Identity Card, Zenith Bank ATM and voters’ card.
Other items found in his possession include verification card as well  as Union Bank and Diamond Bank ATM cards, with some copies of her passport photograph for which he could not give satisfactory explanation.
The prosecutor said investigation into the case was in progress, urging the court to remand the accused in prison and adjourn to another date for mention."
1st April 2017,"Boko Haram kidnap 22 girls, women in northeast Nigeria","Boko Haram Islamists have abducted 22 girls and women in two separate raids in northeast Nigeria, residents and vigilantes told AFP Friday.
In the first attack on Thursday, the jihadists raided the village of Pulka near border with Cameroon where they kidnapped 18 girls.
“Boko Haram fighters from Mamman Nur camp arrived in pickup vans around 6:00 am and seized 14 young girls aged 17 and below while residents fled into the bush,” a Pulka community leader told AFP by phone.
“They picked four other girls who were fleeing the raid they came across in the bush outside the village,” said the community leader who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals.
 
According to the official, the attackers were loyal to the faction headed by Abu Musab Al-Barnawi, the son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf.
Barnawi was appointed last year by the Islamic State group to replace leader Abubakar Shekau, who had pledged allegiance to the Middle East jihadist group in 2015.
Another resident confirmed the raid and said the girls were likely to end up as brides for the fighters.      
“They didn’t harm anyone during the raid and they made no attempt to shoot people running away from the village,” said the resident.
In the second incident outside the village of Dumba, close to Lake Chad, the jihadists killed a herdsman who had tried to escape after refusing to pay protection money, said Adamu Ahmed, a member of an anti-Boko Haram militia.  Related News   MNJTF arrests 900 suspected terrorist collaborators  29 Borno fishermen killed, nine injured in Boko Haram attack — Police  Suspected Boko Haram terrorists kill 29 fishermen in Borno   
“When the Boko Haram gunmen came for the money they realised he had left with everything and they decided to go after him on their motorcycles,” Ahmed said.
“They caught up with him near Dumba where they slaughtered him and shot dead 50 of his cattle.
“They took four women from the man’s family and the rest of the herd,” he said.
The promotion of Barnawi had revealed divisions in the group, as Shekau had been criticised for mass killings and suicide attacks against civilians.
Barnawi and his right-hand man Mamman Nur, who is seen as the real leader, had promised residents in areas under their control would not be harmed as long as they did not cooperate with Nigerian troops fighting Boko Haram.        
But in recent weeks the Islamist fighters have intensified raids in areas near Lake Chad, stealing food from residents.
They have also killed several civilians they accused of cooperating with the military.

30th March 2017,"Kidnappers abduct Lagos lawyer, Sergeant, collect N5.2m ransom","Afeez Hanafi
One Tallest, the suspected ringleader of a kidnap gang operating in the Epe area of Lagos State, has been declared wanted by the police for allegedly orchestrating the abduction of a female police Sergeant, a lawyer and three others.
Tallest and his members reportedly kidnapped the cop in Mowo, a border community between Lagos and Ogun states, while the lawyer was seized in Igbodu, Epe, sometime in March, 2017.
They were said to have moved the two victims, whose identities have yet to be disclosed, to their camp around the creeks in Ketu-Epe and contacted their families on the telephone, demanding millions of naira in ransom.
 
PUNCH Metro learnt that after much negotiation, the lawyer’s family paid N5m while relatives of the Sergeant paid N200,000 before the duo were released last week.
However, four members of the gang were on a motorcycle last Thursday when operatives of the Anti-Kidnapping unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Yaba, who were on patrol in the area, intercepted them.
A sum of N500,000 was said to have been recovered from the suspects –Aboi Feku, 23; Blessing Mimo, 20; and 26-year-old Samuel Yola – who were paraded on Wednesday at the state police command headquarters in Ikeja.      
Other members of the gang at large were identified as Adam and Eke.
Feku, who hails from Ondo State, told our correspondent that his role was to cook for the gang, stating that he got a share of N250,000 from the N5.2m ransom.
The 23-year-old said, “Five persons were kidnapped altogether– three women and two men. The policewoman and the lawyer spent about a week in the camp. We collected N5m from the lawyer and my boss, Tallest, gave me N250,000. N200,000 was collected before the police Sergeant was released. I don’t know how much he collected from the three other persons.”
Mimo explained that he was not involved in the abduction, but admitted to have been given N100,000 from the ransom. He said he was a load carrier in a motor park in Epe, where he met Tallest, who introduced him to the gang.
He said, “One day, I met Tallest and asked him for money, and he gave me N500. He also gave me his phone number. A few days later, I called him and he directed me to the camp. That was how I became a member.
“It was Tallest, Adam and Eke who kidnapped the police Sergeant and the lawyer. Aboi (Feku) and I only helped them to cook food in the camp. They collected N5m from the lawyer and gave me N100,000. They said they abducted the lawyer inside a poultry farm. I didn’t get any share from the money collected from the police woman.”  Related News   Kidnapped Ogun journalist rescued in Lagos after gun battle  Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi  Gunmen kidnap Taraba monarch’s wives, son   
However, Yola, who denied belonging to the gang, said he was a commercial motorcycle rider and was carrying Mimo, Fiku and one other suspect on the run to an area in Epe when the police stopped them.        
The 26-year-old father of two children, who live in the Imota area of Lagos State, said, “From my park in Agbowa, I carry people to Ijebu Ode, Igbogbo, Sagamu (Ogun State) and Epe (Lagos State). It was only Aboi I know. I carried him sometime in February and he collected my phone number.
“Since then, he had been calling me whenever he wanted me to carry him anywhere. Last Thursday, around 6am, he called me to come and pick him at Ketu-Epe. I met him and his friend (Mimo) by the roadside. Another boy also joined us.
“We were going on the motorcycle when policemen stopped us. As they were searching them, the boy ran away. They found money on them and arrested all of us. I have never participated in any operation with them and I don’t know they are kidnappers.  I don’t know anything about the kidnapping of the lawyer and the policewoman.”
Meanwhile, one Solomon Chukwudi, aka King Solomon, was also paraded for keeping kidnap victims in his house in Agbowa.
The 30-year-old horticulturist said his friends, who were still at large, introduced him to kidnapping when he told them that he needed N50,000 to start a business.
He said, “Two of my friends met with me in Ikeja, where I work and they said a man owed them some money. They said they wanted to kidnap the man and promised to give me N50,000. They brought the man into my house in Agbowa and asked me to monitor him. They said they would come to pick him the following day, but the man escaped. The man later led the police to arrest me.”
Briefing journalists on the arrests, the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Fatai Owoseni, said the command would work with the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice to prosecute the suspects within the ambit of the law.      
He said, “We shall work with the government to ensure diligent prosecution of the suspects.
“We urge members of the public to continue to support us with credible information to work on with a view to addressing various security challenges in the state.”

13th March 2017,Gunmen kidnap UNICAL lecturer on campus,"Mudiaga Affe, Calabar
Gunmen on Friday kidnapped a lecturer in the Department of Zoology, University of Calabar, Prof. Edet Ekpenyong, while he was jogging on campus.
The lecturer was said to have been kidnapped close to his residence during his morning routine exercise and dragged for over 100 metres on the road by his abductors.
This is coming barely one week after workers of the institution under the aegis of Academy and Combined Concerned Workers raised the alarm over an alleged plot to kidnap some principal officers of the institution.
 
The university had its 30th convocation ceremony on Saturday.
Southern City News learnt on Sunday that there was intense shooting before the gunmen whisked Prof. Edet away into a waiting boat at about 6.40am.
A source, however, disclosed that a mobile telephone handset belonging to one of the kidnappers was left behind after the operation, adding that at least two persons had been arrested.      
He said, “It was a fierce battle as the kidnappers overwhelmed the school security men. There were gunshots. This whole thing happened close to the professor’s house. They dragged him on the floor for close to 100 metres before they eventually pulled him into the vehicle.
“The kidnappers escaped through a waiting boat at the Big Qua River, which shares boundary with the university. So far, two arrests have been made as at Friday. One of the kidnappers’ mobile handset fell down and it has led to the arrest of two people.”  Related News   Kidnapped Ogun journalist rescued in Lagos after gun battle  Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi  Gunmen kidnap Taraba monarch’s wives, son   
Meanwhile, the acting Head of Department of Modern Languages in the university, Dr. Sampson Uzuanke, had on behalf of lecturers, drawn the attention of security agencies to the threat by hoodlums to kidnap some principal officers of the institution or their cronies.
“We got the information that some disgruntled elements who are working with some forces outside the university have concluded plans to kidnap top principal officers or their children or wards.
“Information at our disposal have shown that those behind the dastardly plot have gone ahead to recruit cultists and hoodlums to cause mayhem within the academic community.
“Such threats can no longer be taken lightly as this group, in collaboration with other concerned workers of the university and security agency, will go the whole hog to ensure that those behind it are arrested and made to face the wrath of the law,” he said.
When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Irene Ugbo, said investigation was ongoing.        
“We are top of the situation,” she said.

“I started staying with my Oga in 2013. He took me from my parents to stay with him so that I could learn how to sell clothes. In the agreement he had with my parents before he took me, he promised to set me up after four years.
“In 2016, he was supposed to help me start my own business; but instead, he opened another shop and asked me to be paying him N20,000 monthly.
“I could not cope because of the recession in the country, so I asked him to pay me as agreed, but he refused. Rather, he sent me back to the village.

The suspect further explained that he kept the young boy in his hotel room for four days, until he was arrested on Apapa Road.
“Throughout the four days, the boy stayed with me in my hotel room at Oyingbo. I called my Oga on the telephone the next day to pay N5m into my account if he hoped to see his son again. I sent him my account number.
“I was on my way to collect my ATM card from the bank on Apapa Road when I was arrested. I never knew that the police were on my trail,” he added.
The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, while briefing newsmen on the arrest, said the suspect, along with one other, kidnapped the 10-year-old boy.
He said after kidnapping their victim, the suspects demanded N5m as ransom to release the boy.

21st January 2017,Borno council boss was arrested not kidnapped - Police,"Kayode Idowu
The chairman of Bama Local Government Area of Borno State, Modu Guja, was not abducted but arrested by policemen, the Borno State Police Command has revealed.
The Chairman was believed to have been abducted by fake policemen as he was taken off in a commercial tricycle that was not usually used by policemen.
According to his close aides, the council chairman was believed to have been kidnapped Friday evening when some men who rode on a tricycle (popularly called Keke NAPEP) to his Lagos Street home in Maiduguri dressed in mufti took him away.
 
The chairman was asked out by the two men for some questioning, but was later whisked off in a tricycle.
All attempts to know his whereabouts at police stations in Maiduguri hit brick walls as all district police officers claimed that he was not in their custody.

But the spokesman for  the Police in Borno, Victor Isuku, later today told journalists that the council boss was found in one of the cells of a police station in Maiduguri.      
Isuku said, “I will blame it on the over-zealousness of the arresting officers.”
He said the council boss was arrested by court orderlies on the orders of a court.
He said the confusion was that the arresting officers “never informed the DPO about the status of the person they brought to the station for safe keeping.”
He said, “It was when messages were sent to all divisions to confirm if they have such a person in their custody, that his identity was discovered.”
The Chairman was however released from detention today in the afternoon.."
14th January 2017,South African freelance journalist kidnapped in Syria,"A freelance South African photojournalist has been kidnapped at gunpoint in northwestern Syria, near the Turkish border, his family and an aid organisation said in statements released on Saturday.
Shiraaz Mohamed was on his way out of the war-torn country on Tuesday when he and two employees from the South Africa-based Gift of The Givers charity were seized.
The incident occurred at a hospital run by the charity in Darkouch, a town 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Aleppo, Syria’s second city.
“When they passed the Gift of the Givers Al Hilal Hospital, two cars suddenly boxed them in,” Imtiaz Sooliman, founder of the charity, said of the kidnapping in a text message sent to AFP.
 
“They opened the doors, put a gun to the head of our two people and looked at Shiraaz.”
According to Sooliman the kidnappers said that they had to question Mohamed because of “some misunderstanding” but then pledged that they would “return him in two days”.
All three had been blindfolded but the charity’s two workers were released. “When our two asked who they (the kidnappers) were, they said they represent all groups inside Syria,” Sooliman added.

Mohamed’s family said they were devastated at the news and “praying for his safety and immediate release”.
His ex-girlfriend, Shaaziya Brijlal said she’d heard from him on Monday when he warned that he could be detained.
“He texted me saying he was leaving Syria the next day, saying: ‘There’s a risk I might be detained tomorrow, no big deal. But wait for my message to tell you what to do,” said Brijlal.
Contacted by AFP, the South African foreign ministry, which closed its embassy in Syria for security reasons, was not able to confirm the kidnapping.
Talks on the future of Syria were announced in late December after a nationwide ceasefire was secured. They are being organised for the first time without the involvement of the United States, which had led all international discussions to resolve the Syrian crisis in recent years.
Turkey, co-hosting the talks with Russia, has said Washington would be asked to join the dialogue being held in the Kazakh capital Astana — likely on January 23, three days after US President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in."

10th January 2017,Gunmen kidnap NATIONAL MIRROR Correspondent,"Friday Olokor, Abuja
A senior Journalist with NATIONAL MIRROR Newspapers, Olufemi Adeosun, was abducted by a four-man armed robbery gang who tied him faced-down under a bamboo tree.
According to Adeosun, the incident which happened on Friday along Ife-Ilesha Road, about 10 kilometres away from the Old toll-Gate, was reported to policemen nearby.
Narrating his encounter with the robbers to our correspondent on Tuesday in Abuja, after his release, he said he was fortunate to have escaped death.
 
He said after he reported the matter to the police, he was simply asked if the robbers had tattoo marks or if any of them was stammering, which baffled him.
He said, “On Friday January 6, my vehicle broke down along Ife-Ilesha Road, about 10 kilometres away from Old toll-Gate. As I was making frantic calls a four-man gang emerged from nowhere and dragged  me into the bush, about a kilometre away from the Expressway.  Related News   Gunmen allegedly attack Delta PDP gov candidate’s convoy  Gunmen kill 400-level UNIBEN student  Anger as gunmen kill 35 in Katsina, Kaduna   
“They were armed with cudgels, daggers and a pistol. After robbing me of the N17,000 in my pocket, they snatched my two telephones-a blackberry classic worth over N100,000 and a small Samsung Galaxy phone. They frisked me, ransacked my pocket and got my First Bank  ATM card. Before demanding my pin code, they tied me with my belt and underwear and lied me faced down.      
“They threatened to kill me if they found out I gave a wrong PIN number. At that time, I knew I was involved in a game of adventure to which I needed to play the honest boy. The one holding the ATM departed for the bank, while one of them, the man with the double-edged dagger and blood socked gun, kept vigil on me. I was bleeding profusely, but was warned not to scream, saying that if I tried to attract attention, they would just pull the trigger. 
“The most striking irony of the whole episode, which became a blessing, was that the leader of the gang said he was a native of Ijere-Ekiti, a neighbouring community to my village, Ikoro-Ekiti in Ijero LGA of Ekiti State. He rebuked the guy who stabbed me.
“I was held for about one hour. The guy who stabbed me, kept vigil on me and finally received a call. The call, I guessed, confirmed that the pin was correct and withdrawal made. It was after then I located my way back to the road. On getting to the bank, I found out that N100, 000 had already been withdrawn from my account.
“The sad story arising from the incident was the attitude of Nigerians to distress calls.  About 30 minutes after I escaped, with blood dripping from my hands, no help came from commuters. Even one or two vehicles with police escort refused to wait to render help. 
“However, help came from a man who emerged from a nearby community with toying vehicle. To God be the Glory. I am pleased to say that I have arrived Abuja, after spending three days in a private Hospital in Ado-Ekiti.”"

24th December 2016,"Fulani herdsmen kidnap ‘corper’, others, demand N15m ransom","Friday Olokor, Abuja
Three women including a member of the National Youth Service Corps have been kidnapped by suspected Fulani herdsmen in Kwali Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.
The victims were said to be travelling in a bus belonging to God is Good Motors on Wednesday when they were robbed at gun point and thereafter marched into the bush. When contacted, Head of Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FCT Police Command), Yemi Ola, confirmed the kidnapping, saying his office had received a report on the case.
He said, “The report was made at Kwali Division from where it was transferred to us. We took a statement from the sister of one of the victims who was inside the vehicle.”
 
Saturday PUNCH learnt that the kidnappers have demanded N15m ransom from family members of the victims. While they demanded N5m from the family of the two sisters, the kidnappers asked for N10m from the father of Grace Oghene Edegware, a graduate of Accountancy from the Delta State Polytechnic, Ozoro, who was deployed by the National Youth Service Corps to Lagos State.
The sister of one of the two victims, Mrs. Florence Chukwuyem, told our correspondent that she had been pleading with the kidnappers to reduce their ransom to N300, 000 as she does not have the N5m they demanded.
She said, “On Wednesday evening, my two sisters (elder and younger) boarded a bus belonging to “God is Good Motors” from Lagos to Abuja; on getting to Kwali, they ran into armed robbers who are all Fulani herdsmen and after a successful robbery operation, they told them to lie down on the expressway.      
“The Fulani herdsmen picked and selected three ladies, including a corps member and marched them into the bush. For the past three days, they have been in the bush with the armed robbers.

“The kidnappers called me and demanded N5m ransom and threatened to kill my sisters if I don’t bring the money. That was my last discussion with them some few hours ago. I have been begging them that I have only N300, 000 and yet they refused,  saying that is no money.”
The father of the NYSC member, Francis Edegware, also pleaded that the ransom should be reduced.
He said, “The kidnappers are demanding for N10m but we are begging them to bring it down because I am a civil servant and I don’t have that kind of money. I only manage to eat. That is the situation, right now.”
Police Public Relations Officer, Federal Capital Territory Command, ASP Anjuguri Manzah, said he would get back to our correspondent for additional information on the incident.

Some gunmen, who have been terrorising residents of Isheri Oshun area of Lagos State, have again abducted two residents of the area.

15th December 2016,"Man kidnaps, drugs church member’s 10-year- old son","Samson Folarin
The Lagos State Police Command has arrested a 25-year-old suspect, Triumph Okechukwu, for allegedly abducting a 10-year-old boy, Chukwudalu Nnaji, in the Orile area of the state.
PUNCH Metro learnt that a tricycle rider, Chinonso Obinna, was also apprehended as an accomplice to the crime.
It was learnt that Okechukwu and the victim’s mother attended the same church and lived in the same neighbourhood.
 
Okechukwu and Obinna were alleged to have lodged in the Sunderland Hotel Annex, a hotel in the area, to perfect the crime.
They were said to have left the hotel on Thursday, waylaid and abducted the victim on his way to school.
Our correspondent was told that the two men took Nnaji into the hotel room, where they forced a substance suspected to be sleeping drug down his throat.      
It was gathered that the 10-year-old resisted the men and the sound of the struggle aroused the suspicion of other people in the hotel.
The suspects were said to have been beaten up before they were handed over to policemen from the Orile division.
A source said the police were alerted to the incident around 10am.
He said, “The prime suspect, Okechukwu, connived with the tricycle operator, Obinna, to take the boy to the hotel, where they had already secured a room.
“He promised to settle Obinna after he had been able to get ransom from the boy’s parents. The boy was on his way to school when they picked him on the road as if they were assisting him.
“Together, they took him to the hotel. They planned to keep him in their room until the parents paid a ransom. However, the boy struggled and called for help, which attracted the attention of people in the hotel.”  Related News   Former minister Graham-Douglas dies at 82  Rainstorm uproots trees, destroys cars in Lagos  Nigeria's Statistician-General dies eight months after appointment   
When our correspondent approached the manager of the hotel, which is on Coker Street, Orile, he denied that the incident happened on the premises.        
A resident, however, told our correspondent that the incident generated confusion in the area.
“The two men were apprehended and seriously beaten up until the police came to rescue them,” the resident, who did not identify himself, said.
Our correspondent learnt that the suspects had been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Yaba.
 A source said the prime suspect confessed to the crime in his statement to the police, adding that he said he planned to collect ransom from the boy’s parents.
He said, “Investigations showed that the main suspect and the boy’s parents attended the same church. Okechukwu said he studied all the members of the church to know those who were wealthy and he decided to go for the boy. He said he only wanted to make money.”
The Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, confirmed the incident, adding that investigations were ongoing.
She said, “We gathered that both suspects, who were lodgers at the Sunderland Hotel Annex, Orile, allegedly accosted Nnaji on his way to school. They lured him to their hotel room, where they administered some substance suspected to be sleeping drug on him. However, the victim was rescued by the hotel workers, while the suspects were handed over to the police.”      
Badmos said the victim had been taken to a hospital for treatment.

15th December 2016,Angry villagers kidnap gang leader's mom,"Residents of a southern Mexican town managed to force a fearsome gang to free a man on Wednesday after villagers brazenly abducted the mother of the criminal group’s leader.
The unusual standoff was resolved with both sides releasing their captives in Guerrero, a state mired in drug violence and kidnappings that often end with the victims turning up dead or never reappearing.
The gang known as Los Tequileros (The Tequila Drinkers) has made a business out of kidnapping people in a remote region of Guerrero, but fed-up townspeople in San Miguel Totolapan rebelled after an engineer was snatched on Sunday.
The residents formed a vigilante group and detained around 20 people, including the mother of Raybel Jacobo de Almonte, the head of Los Tequileros who is himself known as “El Tequilero” (The Tequila Drinker).
 
The engineer’s wife appeared in a video on Tuesday, demanding that Almonte release her husband “safe and sound” in return for the gang leader’s mother.
The residents upped the ante on Wednesday, releasing a video showing a woman identified as Almonte’s elderly mother, Maria Felix de Almonte Salgado, who pleaded with her son to release the engineer, Isauro de Paz Duque.
“Son, if you have (De Paz), hand him over, please. If you have him, I know that you are going to hand him over. Do it, please,” said the mother, stone-faced and sitting in a room without her hands tied.      
After De Paz was reunited with his family, the residents released Almonte’s mother to police, the state government said in a statement.
The residents were still holding 19 people they accuse of colluding with Los Tequileros but the government said it expects them to be released to the police “in the coming hours.”  Related News   US to host Mexico in new 'Clasico' game  UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Teenager, guardian in court for kidnapping children   
‘Satisfying’
Some 220 soldiers and police were deployed to San Miguel Totolapan this week to avoid a confrontation and the government said the security forced were still in the area.
“It is satisfying to inform that the engineer Isauro de Paz Duque, who was kidnapped, is now with his family,” Governor Hector Astudillo wrote on Twitter.
A video has circulated on YouTube showing the vigilantes carrying weapons and explaining that they took up arms in response to crimes committed by Los Tequileros.
“They have humiliated us. They have killed our families and we won’t let it happen again,” one of the vigilantes says.        
Guerrero has endured years of violence linked to turf wars between drug cartels fighting for control of the state’s opium poppy and heroin production areas.
Farmers and villagers in Guerrero and the neighboring state of Michoacan formed vigilante groups in recent years to combat crime in their towns.
Fed up with police incompetence or unwillingness to act, the self-defense groups have detained criminal suspects in the past, but kidnapping a gang leader’s mother is unheard of.
The emergence of such citizen militias have raised concerns that they could be infiltrated by drug cartels and fuel more violence."
11th December 2016,"Banana hawker kidnaps, sells boy, three, in Imo","Chidiebube Okeoma
A banana seller in Owerri, Imo State, Chibuzor Eze, has been arrested for allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old boy and selling him for N450,000.
The suspect was said to be a family friend of the boy, who hails from Umuifa village in Oru-East Local Government Area of the state.
A family source told our correspondent that the boy was playing around the family compound at about 8am when she allegedly took him to Owerri, where the kidnap was said to have been hatched.
 
She allegedly sold him to a man who paid her N150,000 upfront and promised to give her the balance later.
A lady in the village who recognised the boy was said to have raised the alarm when she sighted the woman with him.
Eze and the alleged buyer were handed over to officers at Omuma Police Division in Oru-East LGA.        Related News   Three arrested for killing Philippine governor  Police nab suspected criminal tricycle operator  FG lists crimes prevalent in N’West, S’South, others   
When our correspondent visited the home of the boy, sympathisers and relatives thronged the family house.
The boy’s grandfather, Benjamin Nkemakolam, who expressed gratitude to God for his grandson’s rescue, expressed surprise that the banana seller, who he considered a member of the family, could harbour evil against the family.
The boy’s uncle, Chigozie Nkemakolam, described Eze’s actions as surprising and embarrassing as “she had joined them to look for the boy she allegedly kidnapped.”
When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in Imo State, Andrew Enwerem, said he had yet to be briefed on the matter.

9th December 2016,"Fake policemen kidnap Lagos businessman, demand N50m ransom","Afeez Hanafi
Kidnappers, who disguised as policemen, have left the family of a Lagos-based businessman, Mr. Basil Agha, in misery after they abducted him.
It was learnt that Basil, who is a fuel supplier, was kidnapped in his country house in Umuofor village in the Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State.
He was said to have travelled home to renovate the house ahead of the Yuletide when his family members in Lagos would come home for the celebration.
 
PUNCH Metro learnt that the 69-year-old was seeing off an electrician when the attackers stormed the compound and abducted him.
His son, Ikenna Agha, told our correspondent that the kidnappers later contacted the family members and demanded N50m ransom, adding that they eventually paid them a total sum of N2.6m when efforts by the police to rescue him proved abortive.
Ikenna said, “He was kidnapped on Friday, October 28, inside his compound around 1pm. The kidnappers told him that they were from the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department and ordered him to follow them into a waiting vehicle.      
“I told my brother who broke the news to me on the phone that we didn’t have any issue with anybody. On Sunday, they called me and demanded N50m ransom. My relatives reported at the Orlu Police Station and I also submitted a petition at the Federal SARS in Adeniji Adele.
“Five policemen from the Federal SARS followed me to Orlu. But for the six days that we spent in Owerri, the kidnappers did not call me again. On November 9, we came back to Lagos and they called again. I negotiated with them and we agreed on N2.5m. They asked me to drop the money somewhere in Onitsha and promised to release him the following day.
“After dropping the money, we waited throughout the day, but he was not released. Two days after, they asked for another N2m. We negotiated and they reduced it to N500,000. I said I could only afford N100,000 and they agreed. They called me with my father’s number. On November 14, I told my brother in Owerri to take the money to where we dropped the N2.5m.
“Since they collected the N100,000, I have not received any call from them. I have gone back to the Federal SARS. They said they were communicating with the DPO, Orlu division.”
Ikenna called on the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, and other security agents to come to the family’s aid and rescue the businessman.

“I am totally confused now and so is every member of the family.  I don’t know whether my father is dead or alive. We want the IG to intervene. Anybody with useful information should help us,” he added.
A resident, who witnessed the incident, Thomas Idochi, said he was surprised that what appeared like an arrest to him turned out to be a kidnap.        
He said, “I am an electrician. I came to help him fix the wiring of the house on that day. When I was done, he saw me off. As we were about to reach the gate, three men armed with guns stormed the compound. They were in mufti. They identified themselves as policemen from the SCIID and asked him (Basil) to follow them.
“He asked them what his offence was. But they insisted he would know when he got to their station. They dragged him into the car.”
A police source at the Federal SARS told PUNCH Metro that some arrests had been made by the police in Imo State with respect to the matter.
“We don’t want the complainant (Ikenna) to spend unnecessarily. We are making progress on the matter and some persons have been arrested. We have been liaising with the police in Imo to see how we can succeed,” the source added.
The Imo State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Andrew Enwerem, said the police had yet to get any clue about the victim’s whereabouts.
He said, “We will continue to investigate to unravel those people behind the kidnap. If arrest has been made, investigation has to follow. No information yet as to where the man is. As soon as we get his location, we will go there and rescue him.”

7th December 2016,"Gunmen kidnap three Lagos residents, sack community","Afeez Hanafi
Residents of Ever Winning Avenue, in the Isheri Osun area of Lagos State, have fled the area after two landlords and a woman were kidnapped by gunmen.
It was gathered that no fewer than 500 residents had relocated from the area. Residents seen by our correspondent on Tuesday in the area claimed that only 15 persons were left in the community.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the dwellers started fleeing on Friday when the gunmen, numbering about eight, invaded the neighbourhood and abducted a woman, identified simply as Iya Mitchell.
 
A resident said as the community grappled with how to raise the N6m ransom reportedly demanded to free the woman, the kidnappers stormed the community again on Monday and seized two landlords.
The names of the landlords were given as one Okon, a retired customs officer, and one Felix, who deals in electrical materials.
Only a few residents were in sight while commercial activities had been stalled when our correspondent visited the area on Tuesday.      
A community leader, who spoke to PUNCH Metro on condition of anonymity, said the gunmen sneaked in through a bush path that linked the area with FESTAC Town.
He said, “Some of us were relaxing outside around 7pm on Friday when we heard gunshots. We fled in different directions.
“After they had abducted Iya Mitchell, they went to another building, but the residents had fled. The entrance door of the building was riddled with bullets. We reported the matter at the Isheri Police Division and policemen came, but they left after some minutes.
“The following day, they called the woman’s husband for a ransom. I learnt they asked for N6m, but they are still negotiating. On Monday, around 7.30pm, they came again and took Mr. Okon and Felix. The gunmen were many.
“We are over 500 that live here. You can see how many of us are left. As soon as my children return from school today, we are leaving too.”  Related News   Former minister Graham-Douglas dies at 82  Rainstorm uproots trees, destroys cars in Lagos  Nigeria's Statistician-General dies eight months after appointment   
A resident, who gave his name as Isiaka Rufai, said there was the need for military presence in the community to restore peace and avert a recurrence. He urged the government to take urgent actions to ensure the release of the victims.
“We are no longer safe here and that was why a lot of people packed out. Until Friday when the first kidnap happened, this community used to be lively. The police alone cannot secure this place. We also need military men to be here always. That is the only way we can be assured of our safety,” he said.        
A woman, who declined to give her name, said she had relocated to Ijegun with her children, adding that she only came back to pick some household items.
She said, “I didn’t sleep here yesterday (Monday) after the two landlords were kidnapped. I cannot continue to live here, believing that my family is safe.  If any of us is kidnapped, how do we get money to pay a ransom? My husband said he would wait behind, but I have warned him.”
Another resident, Tobi Adejare, told PUNCH Metro that the area became porous two years ago.
“The bush path is being used to link FESTAC Town; the security of our community has been breached,” he added.
The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, said the police would ensure that the victims were rescued safely.
She said, “Three people were abducted. The case is under investigation and efforts are on to rescue them and arrest the perpetrators.”

Darfur has been engulfed in a deadly conflict since 2003 when ethnic minority groups took up arms against President Omar al-Bashir’s Arab-dominated government, which launched a brutal counter-insurgency.

19th November 2016,Gunmen kidnap 12 people in Mexico,"Gunmen have kidnapped at least 12 people, including two children, in a southern Mexican region where gangs have perpetrated a series of mass abductions, authorities said Friday.
The van that was used to transport the group was found burnt on a road between the hamlets of San Jeronimo and San Cristobal, Guerrero state security spokesman Roberto Alvarez said, citing witnesses.
He spoke of around 30 armed people who abducted “a group of between 12 and 14 people.”
Some of the relatives of the missing have received phone calls from kidnappers demanding ransom money.
 
The abduction may have been perpetrated by a criminal group known as Los Tequileros, Alvarez said.
The mass kidnapping took place in a region known as Tierra Caliente, or Hot Land, where 21 men were kidnapped in January and found alive days later. That same month, four teachers who had been kidnapped elsewhere were rescued, while another was found dead.
Another 21 people were kidnapped and later rescued by police in a cave in the same region in early 2015, and 13 suspects were arrested.

“There has been a phenomenon in Tierra Caliente, which is a very poor, rural and isolated area, of mass kidnappings by members of organized crime who are doing business with this type of crime,” Alvarez said.
Police have detained kidnappers, “but this phenomenon continues to defy the authorities,” he said.
Such kidnappings show that gangs specializing in kidnappings are no longer targeting just wealthy victims in Mexico.
Officials at the state prosecutor’s office say Los Tequileros are hired guns of the Guerreros Unidos drug cartel, which controls much of the opium poppy production and heroin smuggling in the region.
The cartel is also accused of colluding with local police who abducted 43 students in the city of Iguala in September 2014, a case that has drawn international condemnation.
Federal officials have said that Iguala police handed the students over to the cartel, which killed them and incinerated their bodies, though new lines of investigation have been opened after independent experts questioned the credibility of the case.

29th October 2016,"Kidnappers release victims, abduct those who came to drop ransom","Kunle Falayi
For members of a notorious kidnap gang operating in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, nothing could go wrong, but Wednesday, October 12, 2016 was the day the long arm of the law caught up with them.
The nine members of the gang, who were apprehended by the operatives of the Inspector-General of Police Special Intelligence Response Team in a five-hour raid that day, said they were so efficient in their criminal operations that they once kidnapped four victims on the same day.
The afternoon raid led to the arrest of Daniel Gabriel (33), Alaso Igodo (25), Akeodi Aselemi (34), Ayibinmotei Livinus (25), Anikuroka Marshal (33), Biebele Elijah (34) Efiye Anda (34), Daniel Lessor (31) and Isaac Reuben (27), all living within the Port Harcourt metropolis.
 
The police said the gang was responsible for most of the kidnappings that took place within GRA Phase 2, Port Harcourt, Borokiri General Area and YKC axis of Woji in Rivers State.
Saturday PUNCH learnt that the string of events which led to the apprehension of the nine suspects started with the abduction of a woman identified as Mrs. Okotie, who was kidnapped few weeks ago opposite the Royal House of Grace Church in Port Harcourt.
The gang was said to have abducted her in the Mazda car they used as operational vehicle.      
The victim told the police that she had told the suspects that she was not feeling fine but they did not listen to her.
Fortunately for Mrs. Okotie, the car broke down along the way and the leader of the gang named Blackie, called for another vehicle, a Nissan Primera, which arrived shortly after.
“But they did not know that we had got information about them. They were on their way to the Ornage Waterside when we intercepted them. As soon as they saw us, they fled and abandoned the woman in the car along with one of their rifles,” the source said.
Few days after the botched kidnapping of Mrs. Okotie, IRT operatives who were following up on a lead, arrested Gabriel, a taxi driver, around 2.pm on October 12.
When Gabriel, an Akwa-Ibom indigene living at Navy Market Borikiri, Port-Harcourt was taken in for questioning, he confessed that he had personally been involved in 15 kidnaps in the last few months in the state.
 He then led the police to his house where five members of the gang were already planning another kidnap.
 “When we got to his house, we arrested five of his gang members and from there, we proceeded to Enugu Waterfront where we arrested Anikuroka Marshal, the gang’s armourer.   The suspects also identified Diobele Elijah and Akodi Aselemi as their spies who go around town scouting for victims.  They confessed to have three AK47 rifles, two pistols, which they use in their operations,” a police source said.        
Saturday PUNCH learnt that in one of the kidnaps carried out by the gang, on August 10, 2016, a pastor, Mrs. Luis Ubah and one Mr. Chika Ezenwa were abducted. The same day, the gang kidnapped a business woman, Mrs. Ubah in her store, they also grabbed another victim identified as Ezenwa who was with Ubah at the time.
The four victims were taken by the gang to the Indoki Estate Waterfront.
The source explained that while on their way to the waterfront, the gang encountered a police team and instantly opened fire on the policemen.
“Inspector David Ijosi and one Corporal Dike Ledee were injured by bullets in the attack. One was hit in the leg while another was hit in the neck and the kidnappers escaped into the Isaka creeks in Okrika,” the source said.
Soon after, the gang made contact with Ubah’s husband, Bishop Prince Ubah, from whom they demanded a N50m ransom for her freedom.
During the ensuing negotiation, the ransom for the release of the bishop’s wife was reduced to N2.8m and a place was agreed on for the family to drop the ransom.
But in a dramatic turn of events, when two brothers of the bishop, Onyeka Ani and Pastor Okezie Akara, took the money to the agreed place on August 25, 2016, 15 days after Mrs. Ubah was kidnapped, the gang members decided to release her along with Ezenwa but kidnapped the two brothers instead.      
 The police said they then demanded another N1m ransom from the bishop for his brothers. But N750, 000 was eventually paid for their release.
Police investigation also showed that in August 2016, the gang kidnapped one Nkechi at YKC Junction in Woji Town, Port Harcourt, and she was transported to the Woji Waterfront where they ferried her by speedboat to Kula community in Akukotoru Local Government Area of Rivers State.  Related News   Kidnapped Ogun journalist rescued in Lagos after gun battle  Police foil kidnap attempt, kill two in Bauchi  Gunmen kidnap Taraba monarch’s wives, son   
 The woman was reportedly kept in captivity for two weeks and was released after a ransom of N2m was paid by her family.
In September, a victim identified as Coachie, who was abducted around Number One Stadium, Port Harcourt, was released after a ransom of N2.5m was paid.
In his statement, Gabriel explained that he came to Port Harcourt in 2015 and worked as a taxi driver but when things became difficult for him, he moved his family back home and joined his first kidnapping gang.
He said, “I met the members of the gang in March 2016. I was plying the Aba Road looking for passengers one day when they stopped me and entered my taxi.  They asked me to take them to Borikiri in Port Harcourt.
“When we got there, I was surprised that they paid me more than I demanded and I told them that I wanted to know more about them.   The leader who sat in front passenger seat then gave me his phone number and said he would like me to work with them.  
“Few days later, they invited me to a hotel in Borikiri and told me what they did. In April, Blackie, the gang leader, called and asked that I should meet him in his hotel. When I got there, I met other members of the gang preparing for an operation. They showed me two bags containing guns and put it in my car. I then drove them to GRA in Port Harcourt.
“When we got there, the gang’s informant said we had missed the target, a woman, who had just left the place. While leaving, we saw a man driving a nice car and we kidnapped him. He was taken to the Indoki Estate Waterfront. We put him in a speed boat and took him to a camp across the river.”
Gabriel said they carried out many kidnappings and that in August 2016, when they kidnapped Mrs. Okotie, it was like God just wanted them to be caught.
According to him, he had no idea what happened to his car, which he converted from a taxi cab to the gang’s operational vehicle.
“When we were intercepted by the police that day, we left one gun in the car while escaping while Blackie escaped with one other rifle. He gave it to one of our boys, who normally kept our rifles. But after I was arrested, I took the police to the boy and they recovered the rifle and my cab,” he said.
However, in his confessional statement, Anda, a speed boat operator, said he got N200,000  each time he ferried the kidnappers and their victims to their camps across the river in his speed boat.
The suspect, a Bayelsa State indigene, said he was involved in pipeline vandalism and oil theft before the military destroyed the camps in which they “cook” the oil, referring to the numerous makeshift oil refineries that dot creeks where oil militants operate in the country.      
“When I became jobless, my friends invited me to Port Harcourt to join the kidnapping business. I became their boat operator. Apart from the transport duty, I was also in charge of buying food for the gang members and the victims. I bought a speed boat with the money I have made so far,” Anda said.
Marshal (the gang’s armourer) on the other hand, said he was paid N40,000 per each operation.
The suspect, who is an indigene of Opobo-Nkoro Local Government Area of Rivers State, said he usually kept the guns in an abandoned bus parked inside the Baptist Church field in Borokiri.
“I did not usually go out with them for the operations. My job is to keep the guns,” he said.
Another suspect, Elijah, a native of Okrika in Rivers State, said he was lured to the gang by his boss, whom he identified as Elvis.
According to him, his role was to assist Elvis to monitor the movement of their targets.
 “There was a time I followed Elvis three times to spy on a woman we wanted to kidnap. We could not carry out the operation because our leader, Blackie did not come on time. I was also with him in GRA where we kidnapped the woman who was rescued by the police. Elvis had only been giving me little money since I started working with him. But he loved to buy me a lot of drinks,” he said.        
The police said investigation on the scale of the operations of the gang was still on and that they were making efforts to arrest other members of the gang who are now underground.

15th October 2016,American NGO worker kidnapped in Niger,"An American NGO worker was kidnapped Friday night in the Niger town of Abalak, northeast of the capital Niamey, before being taken by his abductors to Mali, a security source told AFP.
“It is too early to determine the identity of the kidnappers, who have returned to Mali. The authorities have put the region on maximum alert”, the source said, asking not to be named.
Niger’s long, porous borders make it occasionally vulnerable to the armed violence that has rocked neighbouring states including Mali in recent years.
Northern Mali, which fell under the control of Al-Qaeda-linked jihadi groups in 2012 before a French-led military intervention pushed them out, remains subject to attacks by jihadists.
 
“At least two people were killed during an exchange of gunfire” as the hostage was being taken, the source said, without revealing the identity of the victims.
“All roads to Mali are being monitored,” the source added.
It is the first time that a US national has been kidnapped in Niger. A US State Department spokesperson told AFP said they were aware of reports of the kidnapping of an American citizen but declined to comment further.      
In January 2011, two young French people were kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey and were killed shortly afterwards during a rescue attempt.  Related News   UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Niger ex-PDP gov candidate defects to APC  Niger terrorists abduct 53, kill pregnant woman, four villagers   
The previous year, five employees of the French energy firm Areva were kidnapped by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM) from a uranium mine in Arlit, north of the country. Four men were freed in 2013 after the earlier release of the sole female hostage.
Earlier this month, 22 soldiers from Niger were killed during an attack by armed men who came from Mali to target a refugee camp in the Tahoua region, northeast of Niamey.
Three soldiers were also injured, according to Niger’s army, which has been deployed along the country’s longer border with Mali to prevent armed groups getting in.
Niamey is also calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Mali.
Despite a peace accord and a 2013 international military intervention, large tracts of Mali are still not controlled by domestic or foreign troops and remain subject to attacks by jihadists.
“To resolve the security problem in Mali is also to resolve the security problem in Niger”, Niger’s president Mahamadou Issoufou said during a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel this week.        
Niger also faces constant attacks in the southeast of the country from Nigerian jihadist group Boko Haram.

8th October 2016,"Kidnappers abduct farm owners, kill managers after N22m ransom","Kunle Falayi
On July 17, 2016, 15 men stormed two poultry farms located at Egan, Itoki area of Ikorodu, Lagos. They went with three AK47 and rifles, one pump-action rifle, nine magazines and 270 rounds of live ammunition.
As soon as the men, who arrived the area in three boats got to the farms, they grabbed the owners, – Alhaji Oyebanji Wasiu and Alhaji Isiaka Owolabi along with the manager of the two farms, 43-year-old Abiodun Adeniyi.
But this was no ordinary kidnap for ransom.
 
When three suspects in the case, who are now in police custody, narrated the event that led to the kidnapping, it became clear that there was a deep-seated vengeance involved.
The kidnappers’ inside man, 24-year-old Idowu Dauwujoh, who is also one of the suspects in custody, told our correspondent that when he got a job as a worker on the farms, he was employed along with three other friends, Kekeminiwei, Afro and Odesebra, all Ijaw young men.
Dauwujoh, who is also an Ijaw man, said few months after they were employed, Kekeminiwei, Afro and Odesebra were sacked.      
He said, “The allegations were that they were stealing from the farms. Then, Afro was dating a lady who also worked on the farms. It became an issue between him and the manager of the farms (Adeniyi) and the man told him to leave.
“I was the only one remaining in the farms, but I was always in touch with the other boys. One day, they called me and said anytime the owners of the farms were around, I should let them know. They told me they were planning to kidnap them and that I should act as if I knew nothing.”
Few days before July 17, 2016, Dauwujoh, called his friends to inform them that his bosses would be around in a few days.
As soon as the owners (Wasiu and Owolabi) arrived their farms on Wednesday, July 17, Dauwujoh gave his friends the signal and they moved in.
Dauwujoh said when they kidnapped his bosses including the manager, he had no idea where they were taking them to. But he fled the farms to Delta State.
One of the suspects in custody, 26-year-old Priye Idoro, said he took part in the kidnapping and was actually the cook in the camp where they kept their victims.
Idoro said, “Before that day, I was not a kidnapper. All I was doing was bursting pipelines to steal crude oil at Igbo Olomu (a suburb of Ikorodu, Lagos, where militants sacked the entire community recently).        
“One day, one of my bosses, who employed me as a pipeline vandal, informed me of the kidnap plan and I willingly went along.
“We arrived at the area before the kidnapping day and stayed in the forest for three days. As soon as we got the signal, we moved in and took the men.”
Saturday PUNCH learnt that the victims were taken deep into the creek where they were instructed to contact their families.
Their families later put together the sum of N22m as ransom which they dropped in a particular location as instructed by the kidnappers.
Idoro said, “The first day we brought the men to the creek, I was told to go and buy foodstuff by nightfall. I bought fish, soup ingredients and garri.
“I was feeding them eba most of the time. Cooking was all I was doing, my bosses were the ones doing the negotiation. When the ransom was paid, they told me it was N20m. They brought the money in a carton and two ‘Ghana-Must-Go’ bags.
“They gave me N500,000. I treated the men well. Before they released them, they were even praying for me that I would do something great with the money I got.      
“One evening, I went to buy food and when I got back, they had released them. I asked about the manager too and one of the men said he had killed him because he was the one who sent him away from the farm, where he was working before. They did not tell me what they did with his body.”
The group dispersed and Idoro travelled to Sapele, Delta State, where he bought a boat with his own share. He said he wanted to use the boat for water transport.
He would later be arrested at Sapele.
The police tracked down Idoro and the other two suspects, after the murdered manager’s phone was tracked by the police and located at Delta State.
One of the kidnappers had given the phone as a gift to his brother, 27-year-old Daniel Jekene, who quickly helped in getting the other two arrested after the police nabbed him.
When Dauwujoh was arrested, it was learnt that the gang had given his N2.5m share to his elder brother to give to him. But the elder brother absconded with the money.
The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Fatai Owoseni, said investigation was still ongoing to arrest other members of the gang.  
He said the suspects would be charged to court as soon as investigations were complete.

30th September 2016,"Woman kidnaps sister’s daughter over N30,000","Samson Folarin
The Lagos State Police Command has arrested a Ghanaian, Enyolam Believe, for allegedly kidnapping her niece in the Ikotun area of the state.
PUNCH Metro learnt that Believe, who had been living in Lagos for the past 17 years, conspired with her friend, Agatha Aigbomiam, to commit the crime last Tuesday.
The eight-year-old victim was alleged to have been kidnapped on her way to school and taken to Ogun State by Aigbomiam.
 
The victim was said to have raised the alarm which drew the attention of residents, leading to the arrest of both suspects.
A police source said 43-year-old Believe and the victim’s mother had searched for the child, including reporting a case of missing person at a police station.
He said, “The suspect and the girl’s mother are sisters. Believe, however, colluded with her friend, Aigbomiam, to abduct the girl so that she could make money from the mother.      
“Their plan was that the friend would kidnap the child and hide her somewhere in Ogun State, while she would negotiate the ransom with the mother on the phone.
“When the girl went missing, the girl’s mother called her and they both searched for the girl. She even suggested that they should report the case to the police. The mother never suspected that she was behind the kidnap.”
The source said while people were looking for the girl, the suspect was also trailing the movement of her friend and the victim on the phone.
He said the kidnapped girl, while in captivity, raised the alarm that Aigbomiam was not her mother and called for help from some Ogun residents, who came to her aid.  Related News   Lagos police arrest car snatcher, recover vehicles  UPDATED: Police investigating Rivers Assembly candidate's abduction - Spokesperson  Ex-politician, wife clash over child’s custody, father-in-law’s detention   
The matter was said to have been reported to a community leader, who invited the police.
The source said, “When the police discovered that Aigbomiam was not alone in the crime and she was receiving calls from Believe, they decided to play along. They asked her to invite Believe to Ogun State.
“It was when she arrived that the police arrested her. The case was subsequently transferred to Lagos State where the offence was committed. That was where the mother of the girl saw that her own sister was behind her ordeal.”        
The suspects, who were paraded before journalists at the police command headquarters in Ikeja on Thursday, confessed to the crime.
Believe said she hoped to make N30,000 from the kidnap, adding that she needed the money for a business.
She said, “I have my own children. I needed money badly that time and I thought of different ideas, which didn’t work. So, I decided to kidnap my sister’s daughter and demand N30,000 ransom from her. I involved my friend because I didn’t want to be the one to take the girl from school. I don’t know what came over me.”
Aigbomiam, a 42-year-old trader from Ekpoma, Edo State, said Believe asked her to kidnap the victim after she returned from a surgery in Benin.
“She said she wanted to use the girl to collect some money from her sister. She just showed me the girl’s school and I kidnapped her around 7.30am on Tuesday, while she was going to school. I took her to my relative’s house in Ogun State. I was stupid for doing such a thing.”
The state Commissioner of Police, Fatai Owoseni, while advising parents and guardians to be vigilant over their children and wards, said the suspects would be arraigned in court at the end of investigation.

A source disclosed, however, that one of the victims, Nwikina, had escaped from the hands of her abductors and was receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital.
It was learnt that some armed men had at about 1.30am broken into the hospital and whisked away two nurses that were on duty at gunpoint.
 
A nurse, who narrowly escaped being kidnapped, Mr. Obi Welly, told The PUNCH that the gunmen numbering over eight, broke into the hospital premises and took away the two nurses.
Welly, who is the General Secretary, National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives, said before the victims were whisked away, the hoodlums inflicted machete wounds on them.
The nurse hinted that contact had been established with the abductors and the gunmen had demanded N5m ransom to secure the release of the nurses.      
He regretted that the nurse still in the kidnappers’ custody had not been paid by the state government for more than three years due to issues relating to employment letter.
Welly said, “About 1.30am yesterday (Wednesday), a group of armed men, numbering about eight, broke into the compound of  Erama General Hospital. The first thing they said was ‘where is the money?’ And the next thing, they forced the two nurses out and made away with them.
“Not only that, they also made away with some of our phones, money, laptops and other valuables, that was after beating the two nurses.  We want to thank God that Mrs. Nwikina escaped from the forest where she was taken to. We are also pleading and praying for the return of the other nurse.
“The gunmen have contacted us demanding N5m. As a group, our hearts are in serious pains as we do not know the state of our abducted colleague. The entire nurses in Erama General Hospital and ONELGA unit of NANNM are weeping helplessly and calling for the immediate release of our colleague.”

Welly, however, pleaded on the abductor of his colleague to free him unconditionally considering their financial status.

Meantime, the Public Relations Officer of Rivers State Police Command, Mr. Nnamdi Omoni said the police were yet to get details of the incident.

OPERATIVES of the Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the Rivers State Police Command have arrested one Egbo Nwanaka for organising the abduction of her elder sister, Ada Nwanaka.
Egbo was said to have connived with a friend to abduct her sister, who operates a supermarket in Ahoada.
The suspect, who was one of those paraded at the State Police Command in Port Harcourt, was expecting one of his relatives to pay ransom for the release of her elder sister.

30th July 2016,We kidnapped Sierra Leonean envoy to raise money for Sallah  – Suspects,"Tunde Ajaja
On June 30, 2016, the Deputy High Commissioner of Sierra Leone to Nigeria, Maj.-Gen. Alfred Claude-Nelson and his driver were travelling along the Kaduna-Abuja Road with no idea of the danger ahead.
The time was 8pm, an hour the envoy and his driver would soon realise was filled with terror.
The envoy’s vehicle was accosted by a gang of kidnappers, who took them hostage for four days before releasing them after N1.5m ransom was paid.
 
It was learnt that some of the kidnappers were dressed in army uniform, which made it easier for them to stop the vehicle.
The kidnappers, who are now in police custody, have made a series of confessions with some of them saying they used to be cattle rustlers but had to venture into kidnapping following the killing of some of their members by herdsmen.
They even said in their confessions that the ransom they got for the release of the envoy was used for the Sallah celebration, which held between July 5 and 7, 2016      
No fewer than 11 of them have been arrested by the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team in collaboration with the Kaduna State Anti-Kidnapping operatives over the incident.
The suspects in custody are 45-year-old Alhaji Rabiu Yusuf (said to be leader of the gang), 27-year-old Garba Abubakar (second in command), Yusuf Adam (20), Hussaini Musa (25), Shuaibu Idris (35), Usman Bello (20), Muhammadu Abubabar (30), Sulaiman Abubakar (25), Musa Iliyasu (20), and 45-year-old Musa Ali, a security guard at the Paki Area Development Council in Kano State, who harboured the kidnappers inside a government building for two days.
In a single file that morning, they all looked humbled by their arrest as they told reporters the role each of them played in the act.
Abubakar, who was the first suspect to be arrested, said when they were planning the kidnap, they never had anyone in mind, as all that mattered to them was to raise money and have a memorable Sallah celebration.
The suspect, who hails from Katsina State, said he used to be a cattle rustler but switched to kidnapping after some of his colleagues were killed by herdsmen while attempting to steal some cattle in Kaduna State.
“I invited my girlfriend from Zaria during the Sallah celebration and we spent part of the money together. In fact, she was with me at Paki Local Government secretariat in Kaduna State, when I was arrested,” he added.
He said, when they staged the kidnap on the Abuja-Kaduna Expressway by blocking the Dutse end of the expressway, some of them were putting on army uniforms.        
“When we abducted the man (the envoy), he and his driver thought we were genuine soldiers until we realised they were being kidnapped.
“We did not know he was an ambassador until we saw it on the news.  We demanded N30m as ransom but accepted N1.5m.
“It was one Umaru, who collected the ransom, but he declared only N1m and I got N200,000 as my share. That operation was the third operation I had done with that gang.”
Another suspect, 20-year-old Balarabe Mohammed, said his job in the team was to drive any vehicle stolen from a kidnap victim to Niger Republic to sell and that was exactly what he did to Claude-Nelson’s car.
Mohammed, who was also into cattle rustling before he ventured into kidnapping, said he never got his share of the proceeds of car sale before the police came knocking on his door.
He said, “We struck that night and we were lucky that he (the envoy) drove into our trap. The moment his car was snatched, I drove it away. I took it to my colleague in Katsina and I allowed him to drive the car to Niger Republic alone. I got my share of the ransom, but I was waiting for Abubakar to bring in the proceeds from the sale of the vehicle when I was arrested.”
Yusuf, who is the leader of the gang, said when he and some of his colleagues were still into cattle rustling, they stole not less than 100 cows in the forest, usually when the owners were sleeping in the night.      
The father of 10 said they always sold the cows to a man named Saleh, who is now dead.
He said two of his gang members were caught and killed instantly by the herdsmen during a cattle rustling operation.
Yusuf said, “We recruited more men after that but last year, Saleh died and there was no one else to receive our stolen cows, so I ventured into kidnapping. I recruited eight persons to form the kidnapping gang. Mohammed, Musa and Sule brought two rifles, 16 live ammunitions and two army uniforms which we used in our operations.”
According to Yusuf, before the envoy, the gang had kidnapped several other victims. One of such victims was a 55-year-old man, Sule Umar, who was abducted on June 15, 2016 on his way to Zaria.
Umar, who was at the Kaduna State police command headquarters to identify his abductors, confirmed that some of the suspects being paraded indeed abducted him and one of his friends had to pay N500,000 for his release.
“When they forced me to pull over, I was approaching Gidwa Takwas, a village off the Abuja-Kaduna Expressway. I thought they were soldiers, but before I knew what was happening, they started shooting sporadically into the air. I was terrified. They dragged me out of my car into the bush and by the next morning, they said I should call whoever would bail me.
“I called one of my friends, Aliyu Tahir, and they demanded N50m, but my friend told them nobody could afford such amount. But at the end, my friend ended up paying the sum of N500,000 to them before I was released. The kidnappers also made away with my Honda saloon car, my laptop, phone, ATM cards and the N65,000 that I had with me.  
“It was a traumatic experience but I am grateful to God that all those who were involved have been arrested and they will be made to face the full wrought of the law.”
Meanwhile, Tahir told reporters that the kidnappers threatened to kill his friend if he didn’t look for the money they asked for.
He narrated, “I begged them not to kill him and the one talking to me on the phone rained abuses on me, I thanked him and he switched off the phone. When he called back after about one hour, we ended the negotiation at N500,000 and I was instructed to take the money to Maraba area of Jos within 24 hours or my friend would be dead.
“They also instructed that I should keep the police out of it. After a while, I got another call from them and I was told to go and pick my friend at Gidwa Takwas, which I did.”
He said he was surprised to see two of the kidnappers who collected the ransom from him in the newspapers, as it was heart-warming to identify those who kidnapped and robbed his friend.

24th July 2016,"Gunmen kidnap two bankers, demand N2m ransom","Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna
Gunmen have kidnapped the Managing Director of the Kadpoly Microfinance Bank Limited, Mrs. Synty Akpojiyovwi, and another female banker.
The bankers, it was gathered, were returning from Abuja after attending a conference of Microfinance banks held in the Abuja when they were abducted on the Abuja-Kaduna Expressway.
It was learnt that the kidnappers have demanded a N2m ransom for the bankers.
 
A source who did not want to be named told our correspondent that the incident took place between 5:30pm and 5:45pm on Saturday near the Jere area of Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
The source said after the two women were abducted, the driver of the vehicle was asked to go.
He said the kidnappers had established contact with the families of the two bankers and informed them about their demand.      
He explained that the kidnappers initially asked for N3m for each of the women but later reduced the amount to N1m each.
“Initially, one of the kidnappers who contacted the families requested that they  pay  N3m each before they could be free but after series of negotiation and begging , they(kidnappers)  reduced the  ransom to  N1 each and vowed not to reduce it,” he said
“The two women among others were taken away and their drivers were left to go .”
The Public Relations officer of the Kaduna State Command, ASP Aliyu Usman, could not be reached for comments. Calls to his phone indicated that it was switched off."
23rd July 2016,"Militants kidnap man, 30, two days after relocating to Lagos","Jesusegun Alagbe
Barely two days after relocating from Aba, Abia State, to Lagos, 30-year-old Opara, a fashion designer, was kidnapped around 8.30pm on Saturday, July 16, 2016 by suspected Ijaw militants.
However, he regained freedom on Monday, July 18, 2016.
The incident, which took place at Iyewo Estate, Akesan, Igando area of Lagos has since left the victim, an Imo State indigene, in untold fear.
 
When our correspondent visited the victim’s residence — a small unpainted two-bedroomed bungalow — on Thursday evening, this fear was evident.
Nobody in the house wanted to open the door despite a series of knocks, until about 10 minutes later when an elderly man, the victim’s father, looked through the window and first assessed our correspondent.
Even at that, he opened the door slowly, his hands visibly trembling. He then called his son, who had spent two days in the militants’ den.      
Narrating the incident of that night, Opara said, “It happened suddenly. It took place last Saturday evening around 8.30pm. Everybody was inside and suddenly our generator went off. We wondered why because it was filled with fuel, so my father rushed out to check what was wrong. The next thing I would hear from my dad was a scream. I was scared, I thought he fell. I came out, only to see about four men with arms. Then they released my dad and held me, collected my phone and wallet and ordered me to move. They blindfolded me and put me in a canoe.
“On getting to their place, they started asking me many questions about my work and family. I said I was new in Lagos. I had been in Aba for the past two years and I just relocated to Lagos in the morning of Friday, July 15, 2016. After some time, they made their demand known. They said I should give them N2m, but I told them I didn’t have any money. I told them that where they carried me from was not a duplex or mansion.”
According to Opara, the militants came through the canal behind the estate and ferried him away into a bush. All through his stay in their den, he was blindfolded and didn’t know where he was.
Explaining how he regained his freedom, he said, “On Sunday evening, July 17, 2016, they asked again how much I could provide, and I told them I had no money. I said my father was an electrical engineer and didn’t have much money. In the night of that Sunday, they removed the veil on my face and I saw two of them. They said, ‘You’ve seen our faces now, right? If you like, go and tell people. We didn’t come for you, but we thought you people were rich.’ They then said I was supposed to have a means of helping them. They covered my face again.
“On Monday morning, July 18, 2016, they called me and asked what I was going to do for them. Then one of them told me, ‘You will go today.’ They spoke in pidgin and Ijaw. I feared that ‘I would go’ meant I was going to die because I heard them cocking guns. Then, one of them told me to say my last prayer.
“Along the line, my sister called my phone and my dad’s phone, which they had seized. My phone rang out like 20 times, then she called my dad’s line. One of them then gave me my dad’s phone and said I should speak to the person. My sister was angry, ‘Give the phone to daddy since I’ve been calling you and you don’t want to pick my calls. Now I’m calling daddy’s phone and you picked it.’ I told her my dad was not around and that she shouldn’t call the line again. She insisted I should give the phone to dad and it was while we were arguing that one of the militants interrupted and made my sister realise I had been kidnapped.

“I don’t know the kind of agreement they made with my sister, but on Monday afternoon, they asked me to stand up. They put me in a canoe and paddled and paddled until we got to a place where they told me I was at home. Along the journey, I was transferred to a speedboat. When I dropped from the boat, they said I should not open my eyes until 30 minutes later. When I opened my eyes, I didn’t know where I was, but it was in a bush. After staying for a while, I heard some voices and then I saw the back of our house.”        
Did they feed him while in their custody? Opara said, “It was on Sunday, a day after they kidnapped me that they offered me porridge beans and garri. I said I didn’t want to eat. They said I shouldn’t starve myself. I managed to eat their food, but I was afraid.”
Opara, who declined his picture to be used in this story or that of his residence for fear of being traced by the militants, said he wouldn’t know the agreement the kidnappers reached with his sister, adding that what brought him to Lagos was to source for money from his sister to buy some equipment to start his fashion business properly.
He said, “In their den, they listen to radio, they watch TV, they read newspapers. I’m still afraid. I wouldn’t know how much my sister paid to regain my freedom because she is out of town now and I’ve not got the opportunity to ask her. She has not even seen me since I was released.
“My sister was to help me with some money to buy fashion equipment, but with the situation of things now, I don’t know my fate. Up until now, we are still afraid, as you can see, we hesitated before opening the door for you.”
The victim’s father, John, said, “I thank God for intervening in this matter. I cried to God and He has answered me. I’m happy to see my son again.”
Meanwhile, the incident has created fear in the hearts of other residents in the area.
A resident in the area, simply named Austin, said, “We have not been sleeping with our eyes closed. Everyone is afraid. We urgently need the help of the police to protect us. But there is a problem because when we learned he was abducted last Saturday night, we went to report to the police, who told us they were overwhelmed because some of them were at the Oba of Iba’s palace, who was also abducted by the militants.      
“They said we needed to provide some money before they could come to our aid. Imagine that! They even suggested that we should go and hire the Oodua Peoples Congress vigilante group. We have been afraid ever since. We need help.”
Our correspondent’s attempts to get the reaction of the spokesperson for the Lagos State Police Command, Dolapo Badmos, proved abortive on Friday as she neither picked calls nor responded to messages.Copyright PUNCH.

22nd July 2016,"Gunmen attack Ogun community, kidnap landlords, rape women","Samson Folarin
No fewer than two landlords have been abducted and three women reportedly raped in a renewed onslaught by some gunmen on residents of Ibafo, Ogun State.
PUNCH Metro gathered that suspected militants attacked Gideon village, Oke Cele and Asiwaju communities in Ibafo, unleashing mayhem on residents and carting away property.
Our correspondent was told that the militants demanded N50m for the release of a landlord in Gideon village, identified only as Joel, who was abducted in his house.
 
It was learnt that before the victim was released, the militants picked another landlord and Joel’s neighbour, identified as Lucas.
Lucas was said to have been abducted in his car and driven to Ebute, where the car was dumped.
He was ferried away in a boat and had since been missing.      
The gunmen were reported to have invaded homes and raped married women in front of their helpless husbands.
Our correspondent was told that on Tuesday, the militants burgled at least three houses and carted away goods in Oke Cele.
Residents and community leaders, who spoke with our correspondent on condition of anonymity, lamented that security agencies could not confront the militants, calling for military bombardment of the creeks.
A resident told PUNCH Metro that the militants usually wrote letters to the communities before attacking them, adding that they moved in groups.
He said, “Before any attack, these militants would write letters and ask residents to prepare for them. When they get to their target community, they move in groups of 30s and 50s. They would go from one house to another, raping young ladies and beating up young men.”
It was learnt that the hoodlums invaded a house in Asiwaju community last Thursday and raped a nursing mother, while her husband was forced to fan them.
A community leader said while Joel was kidnapped on July 9, his neighbour, Lucas, was kidnapped on July 16.

He said, “In Gideon village, two landlords were kidnapped. The first, Mr. Joel, was released on Tuesday after 10 days in captivity. They demanded N50m for his release; I don’t know how much was paid after negotiation.
“Lucas was kidnapped last Saturday. He had not been released since then.”
PUNCH Metro gathered that the militants struck again on Tuesday when they burgled three houses in Oke Cele.
“Ibafo is under siege. A policeman told us that the militants are too powerful for the security agents and only God can deliver us,” a resident said.
A police source told PUNCH Metro that the militants were on the rampage after the clampdown on their pipeline vandalism trade.
He added that they always attacked soft targets whenever they operated.
He said, “Before the Federal Government’s clampdown on the activities of the vandals, they always hobnob with the residents. They eat with them and sleep in their houses. But after their means of survival was blocked, they decided to turn against people in the communities.      
“They always look around to see where there is no heavy security presence. They attack and retreat into the creek. And it is difficult for the security agents to reach them in their fortress because of the difficult terrain.”
The Police Public Relations Officer, Ogun State, SP Muyiwa Adejobi, confirmed the kidnap, adding that Joel had been released.
“We are making efforts to increase security presence in the area and to rescue the second victim,” he added.

PUNCH Metro learnt that the expatriate, who was among the contractors from Granebury Construction Company handling the project, was kidnapped late Monday while working on the site.

28th June 2016,"Vandals  kidnap Arepo landlord, demand N10m ransom","Samson Folarin
Some suspected pipeline vandals have abducted a landlord, Samson Olufemi, on Voera Estate, Arepo area of Ogun State.
 PUNCH Metro learnt that the vandals had entered the estate through the creek and scaled the fence into the victim’s house on Michael Ajao Street.
They were said to have turned off his generator to trick him out.
 
 Our correspondent was told that Olufemi, who worked in a brewery, however, sent his son outside to check what went wrong and restart the generator.
The vandals were said to have emerged from their hideout, forced the boy back into the house and abducted his father.
Our correspondent gathered that the victim had only packed into the estate four months ago, after completing the building.      
 A resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the vandals looted the family’s valuables before disappearing with Olufemi into the creek.
 He said, “The incident happened last Friday night. The vandals jumped over the fence into the man’s house and switched off his generator.
 “The man, who was surprised that the generator went off, asked his son to go check what happened. The boy went out, turned on the generator and was about going inside when the vandals held him. They asked him to lead them inside.
 “When they got in, they ransacked the building and took jewellery, mobile phones, laptops, an iPad, and money. They took all the valuables they could lay their hands on. After they finished, they disappeared with the man.”
 A source said the vandals had been communicating with Olufemi’s wife, adding that they had demanded N10m as ransom.
 It was gathered that the case was reported at the Ibafo Police Division.
 PUNCH Metro had reported that the vandals shot dead an Assistant Superintendent of Police in the locality about a month ago.        
 A resident, who called for government’s help, said security took a turn for the worse when the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation stopped pumping fuel through the pipelines in the community.
 He explained that people had been leaving the estate in droves, saying residents could no longer sleep with their eyes closed.
 He said, “They have always been in the creek, but they never gave us any problem. However, when there were no more pipelines to burst, they unleashed terror on us.
 “The first time they came, they said, ‘Since you are the ones that asked them to stop pumping fuel, you will now be providing the food we will eat.’ We want the government to send them out of the creek so we can have peace of mind.”
 A landlord, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said efforts by residents to increase security in the area had been abortive.
 He said, “We arranged with some military personnel to patrol our estate, but it didn’t work. The route through which the vandals usually enter into the estate was illuminated. It also didn’t work.
 “What makes us prone to the attacks is that the estate is surrounded by water.”      
 The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Muyiwa Adejobi, confirmed the kidnap, adding that investigation was ongoing.
He said, “We are on it. We suspect they are militants. There was a meeting today involving the government and stakeholders on how to put an end to their criminal acts in Ogun State, including the attacks on our communities. We will rescue the victim.”

23rd June 2016,"Militants kidnap five expatriates, kill driver in Calabar","Mudiaga Affe, Calabar
 At least five expatriates and two Nigerians were on Wednesday kidnapped at the Idundu area of the Calabar-Oban Road by suspected militants.
The incident happened at about 6am when the foreigners and their Nigerian colleagues, working for MacMahon Construction Company, were on their way to work.
The construction firm is located at the Mfamosing Plant of the United Cement Company of Nigeria Limited in the Akamkpa Local Government Area of Cross River State.
 
The company is said to be one of the major contracting firms to Lafarge Holcim, owners of UniCem.
The workers, who were conveyed in four MacMahon vehicles, had been escorted by a security pickup that had four armed policemen when they were attacked by the gunmen before the Idundu Bridge.
The armed police escort team could do nothing while the attack lasted.      
One of the expatriates identified as Tim Croot, an Australian and the driver of one of the vehicles, identified as Henshaw, were said to have escaped, while another driver, Matthew, was killed in the process.
PUNCH Metro learnt from a reliable source that those kidnapped were Jack Countentz (Australia); Mark Gabberdy (Australia); Peter Zoutenbier (Australia), Wayne Smith (South Africa), Jamal Khan (New Zealand), Austin Enok (Nigeria) and a driver identified as Howel (Nigeria).
An eyewitness, Akan Akpan, said the kidnappers came down from the bridge where they had kept their boat’s engine running for almost an hour before taking the expatriates and the Nigerians away.
He said, “I was coming back from the farm this morning when the incident occurred. The kidnappers came down from the bridge, shot the driver of the vehicle and took the victims away through the river.
“The vehicles conveying the expatriates and the two Nigerians were abandoned by the roadside with the dead body of the driver. From all indications, it appeared like the expatriates were going to work at the Lafarge Holcim plant in Mfamosing.”
A statement issued by the Communications Officer of Lafarge, Viola Graham-Douglas, confirmed that the kidnapped expatriates were MacMahon contractors.
In a short message, Graham-Douglas said, “One of our contractors, MacMahon, has informed us that a security incident has occurred on the road from Calabar involving some of their employees. MacMahon is working with the security agencies to resolve the situation.”        
Meanwhile, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Jimoh Ozi-Obeh, has said the police are working with the Nigerian Navy to ensure that the victims are released safely.
“The police are aware of the matter. Five persons were kidnapped. They include two Australians, one South African and two Nigerians. The driver of the vehicle was shot dead. The police will ensure that the victims are released unharmed,” he assured.

13th June 2016,"Gunmen kidnap judge, kill orderly in Kogi","Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja
Unknown gunmen have kidnapped a judge of Customary Court of Appeal, Mr. Isaq Momoh Usman, has been Kidnapped.
The Incident occurred along the Itakpe-Kuroko Road on Sunday evening while the judge was returning to Lokoja from his country home.
The Judge was said to have travelled to his country home at the weekend and was returning to Lokoja when the suspected gunmen stopped his car along the Okene-Itakpe bypass in Okehi Local Government Area of Kogi State.
 
Source said that the suspected Kidnappers shot the police orderly killing him on the spot while the driver of the Judge sustained bullet wounds before Usman was taken to an unknown destination.
The source hinted that the late police orderly tried to stop the kidnappers from abducting the judge when he was gunned down by one of the abductors, who also made away with his service pistol.
The driver who was shot several times is receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in Lokoja.      
The information Officer of the Kogi State Ministry Justice, Mr. Saqeeb Saeed, confirmed the incident. The Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Wllly Aya, could not be immediately reached for comments about the incident.
Two women who were travelling from Abuja were abducted along the Obajana-Okene road on Friday, less than two weeks ago after the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Solomon Arase, deployed a detachment of Special Squad of SARS from Abuja and a helicopter in Lokoja to combat the menace of the kidnappers in the state.
The detachment of special squad of Federal SARS returned to their base, criminal  activities of abductors have since resumed."

The Kano State Police Command on Tuesday said that suspected kidnappers abducted and slaughtered one  11-year-old boy in Kano.
The Public Relations Officer of the state police command,  Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP),  Magaji Musa Majia, said on Tuesday that the  boy, identified as Musa Salisu, was sent on an errand by his father within the Naibawa quarters of the city at about 2pm on Monday and failed to return home as and when due.
The police spokesman, however, said that two suspects had been arrested in connection with the abduction of Musa, who he said was a Primary six pupil.
 
Musa’s uncle, Abubakar Kafinta, told our correspondent that the family became apprehensive when the deceased did not come back home three hours after he was sent on an errand.
He said, “It was not immediately clear that the boy was abducted, until three hours later when an unidentified source phoned the family members about the unfortunate development.”
He explained that “the abductors demanded N500,000.00 ransom, to secure the boy’s release or else  they will take his life.”      
According to Kafinta, the matter was promptly reported to the police, while concerted efforts were been made to meet their demand.
Kafinta, who was in tears added, “We contacted them (the abductors) through the same line they used to call us this morning (Tuesday) for a deal only to learn that the boy has been slaughtered.
“The abductors further gave us a detailed description of where they deposited his corpse at a spot on Eastern Bypass, Kano.”
Kafinta added that the boy had been buried according to Islamic rites.

5th June 2016,"We won’t kill, kidnap anybody — N’Delta Avengers","Ovie Okpare
The new militant group, Niger Delta Avengers, that has intensified attacks on the nation’s oil facilities in the Niger Delta region, said on Saturday that it would not kill or kidnap anybody.
It also warned other militant groups in the region to desist from killing soldiers and oil workers as not to offend God in their mission to ‘liberate the people of the region.’
The group advised the public to be wary of suspected fraudsters who now parade themselves as representatives or spokespersons for the group.
 
NDA, in a statement signed by its spokesman, Brig. Gen. Mudoch Agbinibo and emailed to our correspondent, urged the people “to be strong and resolute as it is obvious that God is on our side.”
While condemning the recent killing of some soldiers and oil workers in Niger Delta, the group added that the heavy military presence in the region would not tempt it to kill in order not to derail from its agenda.
It stated, “The avengers are calling on all groups in the region to be strong and resolute as it is obvious that God is on our side.      
“The high command of the avengers is calling on all not to attack any soldier and those claiming to have anti-aircraft missiles should desist from targeting any aircraft. Let us be careful not to offend God in the process of trying to liberate our people from the shackles of the Nigerian government because we need God more than anything now.’’
The statement also indicated that since the military warplanes hovering over towns and villages in the region had not destroyed any property or killed anybody, militants groups with ‘anti-aircraft missiles should dry their gunpowder.’
“When it is time to engage the military in a combat, the whole world will know they started the war and not the avengers,’’ the statement added.
Meanwhile, at least one person was killed and many injured in renewed hostilities between Aladja and Ogbe-Ijoh communities in Delta State over a lingering boundary dispute.
The dead person was said to be indigene of Aladja.
While Aladja is a community in Udu Local Council Area, Ogbe-Ijoh is the headquarters of Warri South-West.
Many residents, especially women and children, fled to neigbouring communities for safety, sources told SUNDAY PUNCH on Saturday.        
The Secretary, Ogbe-Ijoh Warri Governing Council, Aaron Oweizi-Ebiye, told journalists on Saturday that the incident was caused by youths from Aladja community who he accused of invading Ogbe-Ijoh community.
Reacting, Chairman, Aladja Governing Council, Dogene Elias, faulted Oweizi-Ebiye’s claim, saying Ogbe-Ijoh youths started attacking the community on Wednesday.
Last week, the state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, inaugurated an eight-man panel of inquiry to find a solution to the lingering land dispute between the two communities.
Efforts to speak with the acting spokesman for Delta State Police Command, Charles Muka, were futile as he did not pick calls made to his mobile phone.

4th June 2016,"Gunmen kidnap journalist, daughter in Ogun","Samuel Awoyinfa
Abeokuta
A journalist with the Ogun State Council of Nigeria Union of Journalists,  Nofisat Oshin, and her 15-year-old daughter have been kidnapped by gunmen in Ijebu-Ode, Ijebu Ode Local Government Area of the state.
A statement signed by the acting chairman of the state NUJ, Soji Amosu, on Friday, stated that the victims were abducted at gun point at about 8pm on Thursday.
The abducted journalist is the Director of Information, Odogbolu Local Government Area of the state, and wife of a former Deputy Speaker of Ogun State House of Assembly, Tokunbo Oshin.
 
He was deputy speaker under the Otunba Gbenga Daniel’s administration.
The woman was allegedly abducted while she was heading home in her car with her daughter, Afolabi.
They were said to have accosted by the gunmen along Akobi Street in Ijebu-Ode.      
Their whereabouts, as at the time of filing this report, remained unknown.
However, the NUJ has described the abduction as “barbaric” and called on security agencies and state government to help fish out the perpetrators.
Amosu said a formal report had been made to the police in the state by the family of the abducted victims.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, confirmed the abduction story and said the command had swung into action in a bid to rescue the victims.
He said, “The command has been informed of the abduction and we are already working on it, to ensure we rescue the victims from their captors.”"
2nd June 2016,Trader kidnapped in Calabar,"Mudiaga Affe,
 Calabar
A trader, Rufus Umejiaku, has been kidnapped by gunmen in Calabar, Cross River State.
The victim, who is the owner of So Good Plaza on Bedwell Street, was said to have been kidnapped around 7.45pm on Monday.
 
Although the abductors had yet to make demands, our correspondent learnt on Tuesday that two persons had been arrested in connection with the kidnap.
Umejiaku’s abduction came barely one week after another trader, Kenneth Ekeanyanwu, died a few days after N10m was paid as ransom to secure his release from the kidnappers’ den in Calabar.
A source told PUNCH Metro that Umejiaku was abducted on his way home from work.      
He said, “Umejiaku was kidnapped on his way to his house at MCC Road at about 7.45pm when he had just left his office. The kidnappers came in a green Honda car and later exchanged vehicles at Atimbo before heading towards Akpabuyo axis.
“Two persons have been arrested in connection with the kidnap. One of them is suspected to be among the kidnappers, while the other person is one of his aides. They are currently in the custody of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. For now, the abductors have not made any demand.”
The President of the Igbo Community in Calabar, Chief Albert Enya, said the development was worrisome, adding that the leaders of his association had approached the state security adviser to treat the matter with all seriousness.
Enya said Ekeanyanwu, who died shortly after his release, claimed that the kidnappers had a long list of businessmen they planned to abduct in Calabar.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. John Eluu, confirmed that two suspects had been arrested.
“Two persons were arrested in connection with the matter and they are currently being interrogated,” Eluu said.
The Cross River State Security Adviser, Mr. Jude Ngaji, said the state government was working hard to get to the root of the matter.        
Ngaji advised traders not to be discouraged as there would soon be a breakthrough following the large number of persons that had been arrested in connection with various kidnaps in the state.

30th May 2016,"Gunmen kidnap, free lecturer in C’River","Mudiaga Affe, Calabar
A lecturer at the Federal College of Education in Obudu, Cross River State, Dr. Walter Ibe, was on Saturday abducted from his official residence by gunmen.
Ibe, who is in the Department of Computer Science, was whisked to an unknown destination, but Southern City News gathered that the abducted lecturer was released in the early hours of Sunday.
It was learnt that the abductors had demanded N5m but it was not clear if any ransom was paid at the time of his release.
 
This is coming three weeks after three persons were abducted from the University of Calabar staff quarters and released after they were said to have paid N5m as ransom.
Ibe, who is also a pastor at the Pentecostal Church in Obudu, was in his home on Saturday night when the gunmen stormed his sitting room and seized him in the presence of his family.
It was learnt that the gunmen immediately made contact with the family and demanded N5m ransom.      
But the state Chairman of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Pastor Lawrence Ekwok, who confirmed the abduction, could not ascertain if any ransom was paid.
He, however, said that the abducted lecturer is the Public Relations Officer of the Christian body in Obudu.
He decried the incessant abduction of men of God in the state for the purpose of what he referred to as ‘blood money’.
In a statement made available to Southern City News, Ekwok said, “PFN warns kidnappers who have taken the act of abducting men of God to extort money from them to desist from such action or face the wrath of God.
“We hereby call on the police and other security agencies to ensure the release of Pastor Ibe. They should ensure they arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of such evil act without delay.”
He said the kidnappers stormed the home of Ibe in a Toyota Camry saloon that had no registration number.
Meanwhile, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr. John Eluu, said he was not aware of the development.        
He, however, promised to get back after making inquiries, but did not call as at the time of filing this report.

25th May 2016,"Gunmen kidnap UBTH nurse, demand N10m ransom","Alexander Okere, Benin
Unidentified gunmen have kidnapped a 44-year-old woman, identified as Mrs. Rita Aiwelera, at Ugbowo, in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State.
It was gathered that the incident occurred at Igun-Owina quarters, at about 7:45pm on Sunday.
It was learnt that Rita, said to be nurse at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, was whisked away by the gunmen in the presence of her children.
 
The kidnappers were said to have forced her into a Toyota Highlander car.
The family of the victim said the abductors had also demanded a ransom of N10 million for released.
The husband of the victim, Dan, told our correspondent that he had given his family a lift to the teaching hospital, after visiting him in his office on Sunday.      
He, however, said that he was shocked when he was informed by his daughter that his wife had been abducted.
Dan explained, “She came to my office to meet with me with the kids on Sunday. We all went out and, eventually, I dropped them in her office and they joined her car because she came with her own car; they were going home.
“About 45 minutes later, I finished what I was doing and decided to go home. When I got to UNIBEN gate, my daughter called saying, ‘Mummy has been kidnapped.’ I was surprised.
“So, I rushed down to the scene, about five minutes from where I was, and saw my children crying that they took their mother away.”
The husband also disclosed that the matter had since been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department   from the Ekiadolor police division.
“The kidnappers called yesterday (Monday) and asked for a ransom of N10 million. They called again at about 7am today, asking if I had got the money.
“They said they only gave me today (Tuesday). But I told them that I would not be able to raise N10 million,” he said.        
Dan added, “After much talking, I offered to borrow and give them N500, 000 but they hung up.
“I reported to Ekiadolor police station and from there, it was transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department.”
The Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Osifo Abiodun, could be reached for comments, as several calls put across to his telephone number rang out.
He had yet to respond to a text message sent to him by our correspondent, as at press time.
However, it was learnt that two persons within area have so far been arrested in connection with the incident.

10th May 2016,"Rivers: Gunmen kill five policemen, kidnap naval officer, rating","Chukwudi Akasike, Friday Amobi, and  Port Harcourt
FIVE policemen, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police, Mr. Nasiru Halidu, were on Monday killed by unknown gunmen in Okobe, Ahoada West Local Government Area of Rivers State.
The policemen, who were heading to 30 PMF (Police Mobile Force) in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, at the end of their special mission in Yobe State were ambushed by the hoodlums at about 3am.
It was gathered that the hoodlums took the policemen unawares and opened fire, killing all the five cops, who were occupants of a police van.
 
 The hoodlums, it was gathered, thereafter made away with the guns of the deceased policemen.
The hoodlums were said to have left the scene immediately after their operation that ostensibly did not last up to 10 minutes.
A stray bullet was said to have hit a conductor attached to a tanker driver. Tanker drivers usually sleep over in Okobe before continuing their journey to their destinations.      
“One of my coursemates, a DSP; his name is Nasiru Halidu, was among those ambushed and killed by the hoodlums. He was among the police officers and men, who went on a special duty in Yobe State.
“They were going back to Yenagoa after ending their special assignment. It was at Okobe in Ahoada West, along the East-West Road, that the incident happened,” a police source lamented.
The incident was said to have caused pandemonium in the community as some indigenes of the area had begun to leave to avoid being arrested.
Confirming the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Muhammad, said the hoodlums laid ambush for the policemen that were travelling back to Yenagoa.
He dismissed claims in some quarters that the policemen were involved in a shoot-out with some members of a cult group, insisting that the policemen were not attached to the Rivers State Police Command.
Muhammad, who was almost in tears, explained that the attack occurred in the wee hours of Monday, adding that all the policemen, who were occupants of a vehicle, died.
“It is not true that they (policemen) were involved in a shoot-out with cult members. The truth is that they were coming from Yobe State after their special assignment and they were ambushed in Okobe, Ahoada West LGA.        
“They (policemen) were from 30 PMF and were going back to their base in Yenagoa when the incident happened. It has nothing to do with the any shoot-out.
“We are deeply pained by the senseless and barbaric killing of our colleagues attached to 30 PMF, Yenagoa, who were ambushed in the early hours of today (Monday) at Okobe enroute Yenagoa.
“Today’s tragedy again demonstrated the enormous calamities we face and witness in the course of our job. We put our lives on the line every day to confront crime and violence in our communities.
“We will stop at nothing to bring the perpetrators of this dastardly act to justice,” Muhammad added.
Meanwhile, a  naval officer and a rating have been kidnapped by unknown gunmen in Rumuji axis of Emohua Local Government Area of the state.
The officer and the rating, whose name could not be ascertained immediately, were said to be on their way to Sapele in Delta State before they were waylaid and taken away by the unknown gunmen.
The incident, according to a source, occurred at about 4pm on Monday.      
A navy source, who confirmed the abduction of the officer and the rating, told The PUNCH that the duo’s whereabouts had not been ascertained.
The source explained that a call had since been put across to the naval base of the victims while the search for them had started.
“I received a call today (on Monday) and was told that a naval officer and a rating were kidnapped. The officer and the rating were on their way to Sapele when they were abducted in Emohua.
“Their (officer and rating) command is not in Rivers State. It is in Delta State and I have put a call across to tell them about the development, but no response yet,” the navy source added.

7th May 2016,Bride kidnapped days after surviving acid attack by rejected suitor,"Kunle Falayi
Hell has no fury like a woman scorned, so goes a popular saying. But in the case of 19-year-old Fatima Audu, a trader, who recently got married in Lagos, the fury of a man rejected can equally be lethal.
Audu’s case brings to the fore the rarely reported cases of violence suffered by young women in the hand of men whose marriage proposal they reject.
With a narrative that bears some resemblance to the case of 30-year-old Oluwatosin Ashinwo, who Saturday PUNCH reported last week to have been murdered in Ilorin, Kwara State by a rejected lover, Audu has been extremely lucky.
 
In an unnamed street in a suburb of Lagos on Thursday, our correspondent paid a visit to Audu in a house that has come to be her hideout.
She pleaded with our correspondent not to mention the name of the street of her current abode.
Fearing for her life, the young lady is lying low, away from the violent man who made one attempt on her life and also kidnapped her in the last one month.      
Speaking in fluent English that has little traces of her Hausa tongue, Audu, a Kano State indigene who was born and bred in Lagos, told our correspondent that a young man named Mohammed, whose age she put between 23 and 25 once professed love to her and asked for her hand in marriage.
“I know Mohammed but I did not know much about his personal life. He is from Maiduguri in Borno State.  We were friends and he always told me he wanted to marry me. But I always turned him down. We parted ways and I did not see him for a while. I had even forgotten about him,” Audu told our correspondent.
But if Audu had forgotten about Mohammed, obviously the flame of rejection still burn with excruciating pain in the heart of the young man who is said to live in either Lekki or Ikoyi.
On Wednesday, March 30, three days to Audu’s wedding, which was to take place on April 2, the unexpected happened.
Audu said, “I went down the street to buy something around 9pm (around her mother’s house) that day and while standing there, I saw a motorcycle approach with a passenger at the back. I saw one of the two young men on the motorcycle holding a cup as they stopped beside me. I did not think much of it. I just thought he was holding a cup of tea.
“One of them then asked me if I was Fatima, I turned and said yes. He said, ‘Someone sent me to you.’ I asked him who and he did not answer, he just poured the content of the cup on me.
“But as he raised the cup to pour it, I quickly turned my face and the content poured on my arm. I thought he had poured hot tea on me. The worst I could think of was hot water.”        
As Audu’s attackers fled on the bike, the young woman’s arm began to burn. Her first instinct was to race to the hospital.
“I did not know what it was but I started feeling the burns. It was when I got to the hospital that I realised that the man on the motorcycle had poured acid on me,” she said.
Despite Audu’s lucky escape from the attack that could have disfigured her forever, she still sustained some nasty burn injuries on her right arm.
After the attack, then some calls started coming in.
Audu said she started getting calls from someone who had sounded exactly like the young man who poured the acid on her.
Audu’s sister-in-law, who was holding her phone the day after the attack, told our correspondent that when she picked the call, the caller said, “Do you know who attacked you last night?” thinking that he was addressing Audu, the owner of the phone.
Audu who later heard the voice of the caller confirmed that it sounded the same with that of the young man who had attacked her.      
“The caller said that the attack was just the beginning. I got married as scheduled but after the wedding, the calls continued. The same caller continued to call with anonymous numbers, threatening me for marrying my husband.
“He said he would come for me and kill me. Then on Monday April 25, I got a call from another anonymous caller, this time it was not from the voice I recognised. The person said he was my husband’s relation; he said he had been trying to call my husband but his number was not going through. The caller said two of them were on their way to our house to visit us.
“I called my husband who was away at work at the time but his number did not go through truly. I then called my own family and they said if the callers actually said they were my husband’s relations, I should welcome them and entertain them.”
Unfortunately for Audu, she let the strangers in into her new home and as she set water and refreshment before them, one of them brought out a knife and a lighter and told her to cooperate.
They then informed her that someone had sent them to bring her. The strangers said they had been instructed to kill her if she raised the alarm.
Shaking with fright, Audu followed the men into a waiting white Golf car they parked outside.
Audu said, “They took me to Ikeja. I remember seeing the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. We went past it and turned left into a street, where they kept me in an uncompleted building around 7pm that day.  
“They said they would kill me there and I began to beg them. But they said the man who sent them would come soon. About one hour later, the man came. It was Mohammed.”
According to the young woman, she could not believe her eyes that Mohammed had been the one behind the attack all along.
She said she began to beg him but he said the only thing that could save her from death was to leave her husband.
“He gave me my phone that they had collected earlier. I was told to call my family and apologise for my intention to leave my husband. I called my brother but while I was speaking with him and he was asking where I was, Mohammed snatched the phone. I began to beg him again and finally pleaded with him that I would do as he wished. I told him I would leave my husband,” she said.
Audu said Mohammed and his goons later left her alone in the room and told her they were watching her. They then dared her to raise the alarm, threatening to cut her throat. She said they left her to sleep till morning.
The following day, with assurance that she would actually leave her husband, Audu got her phone back and was released. Mohammed told her he would come after her if she told anybody his identity or if she failed to leave her husband.
 She would later call one of her siblings who came to pick her at  Ikeja bus stop.      
She said she still remembered the uncompleted building but not the name of the street.
According to her description, it is likely Audu was taken to an uncompleted building in GRA Ikeja. The police at the Abbatoir Division, Agege, where the case was reported said they would be visiting the location described by Audu on Friday as part of the investigation to track down Mohammed and his cohorts.
Nobody could really tell our correspondent what the suspect does for a living.
All Audu could offer was his description as a slim, dark young man of about five feet eight inches height. She said he has no tribal marks.
At the moment, she is living in fear of the unknown, unable to go back to her husband’s house in Oko-Oba Agege, where she was kidnapped.

Some unknown gunmen on Friday morning abducted three officials of the Osun State Government, including the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Mrs. Adebimpe Ogunlumade; the Director, State Audit, Mr. Tajudeen Badejoko; and their driver, Mr. Oladapo Arogundade.
The trio were kidnapped by the gunmen between Obajana and Lokoja, the Kogi State capital, on their way to Osogbo, the Osun State capital, from a programme organised by the World Bank and the European Union on local government reforms in Abuja.
The state officials were said to have been stopped by the gunmen, whisking them away.
 
However, sources said a fourth official, identified as an auditor, escaped from the grip of the abductors.
A civil servant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told one of our correspondents that the incident left workers at the state secretariat shocked when the news filtered.
It was not clear if the kidnappers had contacted the families of the captors or the state government as of the time of filing this report.      
Meanwhile, the Head of Service in Osun State, Mr. Sunday Owoeye, confirmed the abduction in a statement issued on Friday.
The statement read, “The State Government of Osun wishes to alert on the unfortunate kidnap of three of its officials today, Friday, April 22, 2016 in Kogi State.
“The kidnapped officials are the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Finance, Mrs. Adebimpe Ogunlumade; Director, State Audit, Mr. Tajudeen Badejoko; and their driver, Mr. Oladapo Ajani Arogundade.

“We appeal to all Nigerians for information that could lead to their immediate release.”
The Kogi State Police Commissioner, Mr. Yakubu Umar, who said he was in Abuja, said he had yet to be briefed when one of our correspondents contacted him.

13th April 2016,"Woman kidnaps her kids, demands ransom from husband","Friday Amobi, Port Harcourt
THE Rivers State Police Command has arrested a woman, Mrs. Abigail Brown, for kidnapping her two children to get ransom from her husband.
Brown and her husband’s former driver, identified simply as ThankGod, were said to have kidnapped Abigail’s two children and called the husband to pay a ransom to secure their release.
Brown initially denied the allegation against her, but later said the act was not intentional.
 
She told PUNCH Metro that it was frustration that made her to commit the crime, adding that she had no means of survival.
She claimed that her husband had abandoned her and the two children to suffer, adding that the kidnap was the only means of making some money from her husband.
It was gathered that the suspect had abducted her two children, aged two and 10 respectively, and hid them in her sister’s place.      
She was said to be awaiting the ransom from the husband before she was apprehended by the police.
She said, “I did it because of frustration. My husband abandoned me and my children.
“Since he left us and went away, I have been suffering with my children, and I know that he has money.
“I only did it to make him bring money for me to take care of the children we had together.”
It was learnt that the suspect had demanded N6m as ransom to secure the release of the two children.
She said, “I did not demand up to that amount, but I demanded money from my husband.”
 ThankGod, the former driver to the woman’s husband, who accepted taking part in the act, said his former boss’ wife contacted him.        
ThankGod said, “She called me to help her. She told me to take the two children to her sister’s place. That is how I got involved.
“She used me to act as the kidnapper of the two children before we were arrested. She lured me into it.”
Meanwhile, the state police command on Tuesday paraded 146 suspected criminals in the state.
The Police Public Relations Officer of the command, DSP Ahmad Muhammad, said the suspects were arrested in separate raids by the police in different communities of the state.
Muhammad, who paraded the suspects on behalf of the Commissioner of Police, Musa Kimo, noted that the 146 persons were arrested in connection with armed robbery, kidnap and cult related activities in the state.

The suspect, who claimed to have studied Insurance at a polytechnic in the state, said he committed the crime because his in-law refused to support him.

24th March 2016,"Gunmen kidnap artisan, demand N10m ransom","Friday Amobi, Port Harcourt
UNIDENTIFIED gunmen have struck in Isiokpo community in the Ikwerre Local Government Area, kidnapping an artisan.
The artisan, Mr. Godspower Nyeke, who fixes aluminum doors and windows to earn a living, was abducted on Tuesday by the hoodlums where he was working inside a building.
The suspected kidnappers were said to have established a contact with the relatives of their victim and were demanding N10m as ransom.
 
Nyenke, who also owns a building material shop in Isiokpo, was said to have been kidnapped with his apprentice.
The gunmen were said to have stormed the building with three motorcycles and whisked away their targets.
Sources disclosed that Nyeke and his apprentice were trailed by their abductors before they later came in and whisked them away.      
The apprentice was said to have escaped from the kidnappers’ den.
A family source said contacts had been established with the abductors of the artisan.
He said, “We are very surprised to hear that our brother has been kidnapped even when he does not have money. They just came and kidnapped a young boy that is struggling to survive in this harsh economy.
 “They followed him to the place where he was fixing keys because that is what he sells; and they kidnapped him. The kidnappers have called us and they are saying we should bring N10m for them to release our brother. Where can we get such amount?
“If any of us has N10m, it means he is rich. But we don’t have such an amount of money. We are appealing that they should release our brother. He is not a rich man; he is only managing to survive.”
Efforts made to reach the Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, to react to the matter proved abortive as calls to his mobile phone were not answered, while a text message sent to him was also not replied to.

Members of the Taraya Ekklesiyoyin Kristi A Nigeria (Fellowship of Churches of Christ in Nigeria, TEKAN), have been thrown into confusion following the kidnapping of their President, Dr. Emmanuel Dziggau.
Dziggau was said to have been kidnapped on Monday along with his deputy, Rev. Illiya Anto, and a retired reverend in the church, Yakubu Dzarma.
Anto was later released on health grounds.
 
TEKAN General Secretary, Rev. Moses Ebuga, told newsmen in Jos on Tuesday that the three men were kidnapped in Kaduna.
Dziggau is also the president of Haddiyar Ekklesiya Kristi A Nigeria (United Church of Christ in Nigeria) and the TEKAN/ECWA bloc leader in the Christian Association of Nigeria.
The three men were said to have been kidnapped at the church crusade ground along the Kaduna-Abuja highway on Monday morning.      
It was learnt that the masked gunmen stormed the crusade ground and picked the three men while other church members fled.
The General Secretary of the church and one of the eyewitnesses, Rev Jibrailu Wobiya, who confirmed the abduction to one of our correspondents, said Dziggau and some members were at the area to clear the crusade ground for a forthcoming church programme.
Ebuga called on the Federal Government and security operatives to do everything possible to ensure the safety of the clergymen.
He said the kidnappers had contacted him and demanded a ransom of N100m.
Ebuga described the abduction of the clerics as shocking, calling for their immediate release.
He said the three men might have been kidnapped because of the oncoming CAN national election.
He added, “We are not ignorant of the recent scheming against the Nigerian church with regard to the upcoming CAN national election, where the leaders have become the subject of attacks, particularly the leadership of TEKAN/ECWA bloc in CAN.        
“As a body, we are calling on the government to do everything possible to ensure the safety of the leaders,  unearth their whereabouts and to have the perpetrators fished out.
Ebuga called on the TEKAN churches and the Nigerian church to rise up in prayer against the ugly development, asking them to pray that God would expose the sponsors and perpetrators of the kidnapping.
The Kaduna State Police Command had yet to confirm the kidnapping of the pastors on Tuesday.
The Police Public Relations Officer of the command, Abubakar Zubairu, did not return repeated telephone calls to his mobile.
The Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in Kaduna State, Rev. George Dodo, described the pastors’ abduction as “unpleasant and shocking.”
The CAN’s chairman, while confirming the incident, said he just heard of the “unpleasant” development on Tuesday, calling on security agencies to do all they could to unmask the perpetrators of the heinous crime.
Dodo stated, “I heard about it this afternoon; it is an unpleasant news, a shocking news to everybody. Government should put in motion all its security apparatus to ensure the liberation of those abducted.”      
The spokesman for the Northern States CAN, Rev. Josesph Hayab,  condemned the abduction of the clerics.
He called on the kidnappers to release the three men unconditionally or be prepared to incur the wrath of God.

1st March 2016,[UPDATED] BREAKING: Gunmen kidnap three female students in Lagos,Afeez Hanafi
27th February 2016,I kidnap people to raise money for my girlfriend’s bride price –Suspect,"Tunde Ajala

Uzordima Chukwudi, 29, was a lotto operator before he took to kidnapping, a trade he was into before he was arrested by the Inspector General of Police Special Intelligence Response Team, led by CSP Abba Kyari.
Chukwudi was arrested alongside some other members of the group, including Joseph Chiaotu, aka Ejima, 21, Anozie Chinonso, 25 and 27-year-old Chukwuma Agim, who is a prison official, in connection with the kidnap of a woman in Imo State.
Speaking to journalists during the week, Chukwudi said he was studying Mechanical Engineering at Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Imo State before he dropped out in his final year. “What led me into kidnapping was unfortunate,” he said.
 
He explained that the pressure to raise the bride price of his pregnant girlfriend lured him into the crime. He said, “My girlfriend is pregnant and I have been under pressure to pay her bride price but I had no money. She told me that since she became pregnant her mother had been ostracised by her fellow women in their village. The pressure was too much that I needed to look for money by all means.”
On how he came across the other suspects, Chukwudi explained that when the pressure became unbearable, he contacted two of his friends; Nnamdi, who is now in prison, and Chiboy, who later introduced him to Agim for the trade.
He said, “Agim, being a prison official, was the one making way for us whenever we approached a police check point but our first operation was not successful because the person we targeted escaped. But on the second operation, Chiboy went with a policeman and they kidnapped the woman.”      
He said for his involvement in the deal and for taking food to the victim in the bush, he was given N100,000 as his share. He said, “Chiboy told me that he got only N1.1m from the woman but when we were arrested, the woman told us she paid N3m as ransom. The moment I got my own share, I gave my girlfriend part of it to start the preparation (for the wedding) while I went to the market to buy drinks. That was when I got a call from Agim and when I met him I was arrested.”
Agim, a prison official from Imo State who said he was lured into the trade by an inmate, Nnamdi, told journalists that even though he was able to buy clothes, settle his debts and fix his car with his N100,000 share in the ransom paid by the victim’s family, he regrets his involvement in the act.
He recalled that when he was posted to the Owerri prison, his mother, who was also serving in the prison, warned him to be wary of one inmate, named Vampire, and his friends so as not to get into trouble. He maintained that he was reluctant when Nnamdi approached him but that he later found the offer attractive.
He began, “I was in my final year student in Imo State University where I was studying Insurance. I was earning N43,000 monthly as a prison official and I was even thankful because I didn’t join the Service with a first degree.
“When I came for industrial attachment last year, our chief warder told us that there was a notorious kidnapper called Vampire who was arrested and would be brought to Owerri Prison. Early this year I met Nnamdi who was in the same cell with Vampire. Nnamdi first asked me to get him a phone and he offered me N3,000 but I refused. So, he met another officer who got him the phone. They kept pressurising me that they wanted us to be friends.
“So, one day, we sat behind the food store and they told me several stories about their escapade in kidnapping and I found it attractive. They told me they were rich people and they used to visit several popular bars in major towns in the South East and South South states and that when they observe rich people leaving the bar, they go after them and kidnap them.”
He said at the end of the conversation, they gave him a number and that with that he was able to link other members, including Chiboy, aka Eze Ekudeley, whom he called a big kidnapper, Ejima and Chukwudi.        
He said they used to work with a policeman and that on the day they went to pick their victim, a woman, she wasn’t the main the target but she was traced to her house where she was picked.
“It was Nnamdi who called me to and look after the woman in the bush. I borrowed money from a friend and used it to buy food for the woman. I gave the food to Uzordima to give to the woman. I learnt the woman stayed for two days. I was given N100, 000 after the N1.1m ransom was collected. I bought clothes, settled my debt and fixed my car.
He said he was arrested few days after the operation. “It was Ejima who led them to me. I regret getting myself into this mess he lamented,” he added.
On his part, Ejima said his share of the ransom was N70,000, out of which he used N10,000 to buy shoes and clothes. “I don’t know how the police heard about what I did; they came after me and arrested me. I led the police to arrest the prison official and four other members of the gang, but we were unable to arrest Chiboy. He noticed the presence of the police and he attempted to escape. He ran into the bus and the police fired several shots at him but he wasn’t hit.
Chinonso, who also hailed from Imo State, said poverty led him into kidnapping. “All I was looking for was a little money to buy a bus on hire purchase because the one I had got spoilt. I met Ejima recently and I told him I needed assistance because I had no job. He promised he would help me.”
He explained that he participated in the kidnap and that his share was N100,000 but that he was arrested when he was about hiring a bus. “It was poverty that led me into this crime. I am a very poor person struggling for myself and my family. I have no one helping me and my mother is a very old woman. I pray this woman (the victim) and her family would forgive me, he said.

This came barely four days after a similar fate befell five passengers of a commercial bus who were whisked away by the miscreants terrorising the area.
However, the Police had confirmed the rescue of four of the six abductees, while intensifying efforts to rescue the last victim, as well as to apprehend the fleeing suspects.
On the latest incident, a driver at the Choba Park, in Obio-Akpor Local Government Area of the state, confirmed the kidnap to our correspondent on Wednesday morning.

He said the incident occured at about 8pm, on the same spot where a commercial bus driver was killed and eight of his passengers kidnapped a fortnight ago, as well as well the abduction of five passengers last Saturday.
He said,”There were two persons in the car. The driver and another man. The vehicle was loaded with adulterated kerosene.      
“The kidnappers took two of them and left the vehicle there. Policemen went and saw the car and they were acting as if something was scaring them away from the car.
“A driver that drove past the vehicle said it occured around 8pm in the night.  He said when he was coming, he saw the two occupants of the vehicle coming towards Choba.

He called for the immediate enforcement of a ban on night travels on the Emuoha-Kalabari road.
Also, a native of Abonnema, a Kalabari speaking community, Mr. Emmy Georgewill, disclosed that the kidnappers have contacted a friend of one of the abductees and demanded a random of N50 million.
George said,” These kidnappers are camped in the Emuoha bushes, I stand to be corrected.
“If they don’t come in a car, when they kidnap people, they will carry their captors on foot into the bush.

The terrorists were said to have blocked the road where no fewer than 30 vehicles were trapped and passengers’ loads were carted away.
The captive drivers were made to pay between N300,000 to N1,000,000 to the terrorists before their vehicles were released. 
The Chairman of the Birnin-Gwari Emirate Progressives Union, Ishaq Kasai, disclosed this in a statement released in Kaduna on Sunday.
 
He said, “On Thursday, September 15, 2022, armed bandits kidnapped three locals at farms in Kurgin Gabas Community in the western part of Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
“The bandits also enrouted the same Community on Friday, September 16, to steal a motorcycle (Bajaj model), killing the owner (Bala Balansi) instantly before going back to the forest.  Related News   Katsina police engage terrorists on highway, kill one, recover AK-47  Terrorists kill Kaduna cleric, abduct three, demand N50m  Terrorists kill Kaduna clergy, abduct wife, release over 100   
“Kurgin Gabas is sharing border with Kamuku Forest Reserve which becomes the hideouts of armed bandits and a common route through which the bandits usually come out from their hideouts to carry out attacks in communities in the western part of Birnin-Gwari and in the neighbouring Rafi LGA of Niger State.      
“BEPU acknowledges that the security level at Birnin-Gwari to Kaduna Highway has improved following the earlier visit by GOC of 1 Div Kaduna and subsequent mobilization of troops as well as occasional aerial surveillances along the road by security agencies. The Union also observes that, attacks are being carried out to some hideouts of the bandits particularly around Birnin-Gwari and Chikun adjoining forests.
“However, BEPU is deeply concerned that, Birnin-Gwari/Funtua Highway remains blocked by armed bandits where about 30 vehicles including big trucks are trapped and yet to be retrieved by owners; and many of the travellers that were abducted during the attack on September 1, 2022 are yet to be released.
“Another disturbing scenario is that, the bandits have carted away all the loads/goods contained in the trapped vehicles and people were forced by the armed bandits to pay huge amount of money ranging from N300,000 to N1,000,000 in order to bail and retrieve their trapped vehicles from the road. The charge disparity depends on the size and nature of the vehicles.”
The union appealed for mobilization of troops to ensure opening of Birnin-Gwari-Funtua road and for retrieving the trapped vehicles unconditionally.
“The Union believes that, opening of the road and sustained surveillance will help in addressing the problem of attacks on travellers  and in bringing permanent peace as well as enhancing business and other economic activities in Birnin-Gwari LGA,” the statement added."

It was gathered that the gunmen shot the driver dead in a commando-like fashion and immediately took all passengers into a forest on Saturday night, even as they fired shots into the air to ward off any threat and escaped unchallenged.
 
Our reporter later learnt that one of the kidnapped travellers was freed after parting with about N150,000, while others were still in captivity.
A driver plying the route, who did not want his name in print, lamented that despite a protest calling on relevant security agencies to rise to the occasion, the frequent attacks had now led to the death of one of them.
“We had protested on our Kalabari-Emuoha-Buguma road because of the series of kidnap incidents and the shooting of our drivers and passengers.      
“Even the Commissioner of Police sent a representative. After then, there has been an increase in kidnapping attempts and incidents.
“But yesterday, the worst of it happened. They (miscreants) killed one of our drivers by name Salvation Harry, who is from Buguma. As I am talking to you now, he is in the Buguma mortuary. And the occupants of the vehicle are in the bush with the kidnappers.

“Maybe because we are not violent and cannot resort to carrying arms to protect ourselves on that road. We are tired,” he explained.
The eyewitness said the presence of security personnel on the road had not solved the challenge in the area and accused the policemen of paying attention to people carrying illegally refined petroleum products.
He said, “The police on their part are just concerned about collecting money they will collect from drivers and exploiting passengers.
“Their concern is the number of illegally refined products they will carry. Otherwise we have not seen a situation whereby we have nine to ten security checkpoints on that road, yet they killed our driver last night and took the occupants of the vehicle.        
“We don’t know what will become the fate of the passengers in the bush. If they could kill the driver, then we don’t know the fate of the passengers.
“So, we are appealing to relevant authorities to come to our aid. We are law abiding citizens. This is where we feed our families and fend for ourselves.”
When contacted, the spokesperson of the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko, confirmed the incident.
Iringe-koko said the police have launched an investigation into the incident to ensure that the travellers are rescued as well as to apprehend the abductors.
She said, “Yes we are aware of it and we have launched an investigation into the incident, and a manhunt to ensure the kidnappers are apprehended.”"

The statement read in part, “Disturbed by the gory video images of four teenage children belonging to same family he saw in the last video released by the attackers of the AK9 Train, Gumi, for the first time since the abduction of the innocent passengers of that train over four months ago, reached out to the abductors through his media consultant, and sent Allah’s messages to them and consistently pleaded with them to consider the release of the poor children and their innocent parents.
“It was learnt that the health condition of two of the children has deteriorated since the flogging incident that affected their helpless father. A total of additional seven hostages were therefore released on Wednesday.

“While she tried to come back, she hit her head on the cross at the entrance. It was the noise that woke up the assistant shepherd, who was sleeping in the church and also alerted the Sunday school teacher in the other room.

He said, “We are appealing to the state governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma to come to our rescue.      
“This morning, some masked gunmen invaded our community, Ekwe through Amucha, arrested some young men who were excavating sand at Njaba River.

While recalling how a medical doctor was kidnapped while on duty at a health centre at Ikot Ekpaw in the Mkpat Enin LGA, the youth leader said more than 18 persons had been abducted in the last six months.

22nd March 2022,"Again, bandits raid Kaduna, Zamfara, kill 62, abduct 62, raze 70 houses","The orgy of violence in the northern part of the country has claimed 60 lives in Kaduna and Zamfara states.
Twenty-five persons, including two military personnel, were reportedly killed, while a riot policeman allegedly shot a passerby and no fewer than 70 houses were razed on Sunday following an attack by terrorists on Agban Kagoro in the Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
The two local governments are in the Southern Kaduna area of the state and share boundaries.
In Zamfara State, bandits killed 37 persons and kidnapped 62 others in Juyi and Doruwa villages in the Bungudu Local Government Area, while 20 others were killed in Ganar-Kiyawa village in the Bukkuyum Local Government Area on Saturday.
 
The Kaduna killings sparked protests on Monday as irate youths from the affected area blocked the road and attacked travellers.
It was learnt that a bus was set ablaze during the protest as riot policemen fired into the protesting youths, with a bullet allegedly hitting one of the protesters.
This forced the state government to impose a 24-hour curfew on the Jema’a and Kaura local government areas of the state.      
The Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, who announced this in a statement, said the measure was to allow security agencies to save lives and property, and restore law and order in the areas.
The statement said the government appealed to residents of the local government areas to cooperate with security agencies to restore peace, law and order.
The commissioner quoted Governor Nasir El-Rufai to have condemned the violence that left many dead and property destroyed.
The statement titled, ‘KDSG declares 24-hour curfew in Jema’a and Kaura LGAs’, read, “Following advice from security agencies, the Kaduna State Government has declared a 24-hour curfew in Jema’a and Kaura local government areas with immediate effect. This is to assist the security agencies to stabilise the situation in the areas, save lives and property, and enable the restoration of law and order.
“A statement from the Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs said the security agencies had full authorisation to enforce the curfew. The government appeals to all residents of the Jema’a and Kaura local government areas to cooperate with the security agencies in the urgent task of restoring peace and upholding law and order.
“The government condemns the violence and all acts of lawlessness that have occurred in the area.”
The District Head, Kukum community in the Kagoro Chiefdom, Mr Jashua Kagoya, who narrowly escaped the attack, said the terrorists invaded the community in a military van with sophisticated weapons and took vantage positions.        
According to him, the villagers retired home after their normal activities when they suddenly heard gunshots around 8pm and they had to flee the community.
Kagoya stated, “As you can see, my personal house is completely razed down, but I thank God that my family members and I were able to escape the attack.
“It is very sad that such carnage has been meted out on the peace loving people of Kagoro. We condemn this act in totality and we’re calling on the government to rise to its primary responsibility of protecting lives and property.”
The district head disclosed that 23 corpses had been recovered, while a search was on for others.
The Wakilin Yanmma of Kagoro Chiefdom, Mr Yanshen Sunday, said when he heard gunshots, he contacted the Commandant of the Operation Safe Haven, who promised to respond immediately, which he did.
Sunday said, “While we were trying to figure out what was happening, I saw two military vans and thought the military men came to defend our community, but to my greatest surprise, they were the attackers.
“Before we knew it, the whole place was on fire. We have recovered 23 dead bodies, but I cannot ascertain the number of houses burnt down.      
“While some youths were reacting to the killings, a riot policeman was alleged to have shot dead a passerby, which escalated the tension in the Jema’a Local Government Area.”
A resident of the community, Mr Derek Christopher, said the terrorists came in large numbers in military vans, buses and motorbikes.
He stated, “Two military officers were killed by the attackers.
“Before now, a lot of locals could not access their farmlands for fear of being killed. We’re calling on the government to immediately deploy security in the Agban community to ensure that the people are safe.”
An indigene of the Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Sani Ibrahim, told one of our correspondents that the terrorists, who rode on motorcycles, attacked Juyi and Dorawa villages of the Kekun Waje around 2pm on Saturday and killed 17 villagers and kidnapped 62 others.  Related News   Bandits’ attacks force Plateau pupils out of school  Worst of insecurity is over, says FG  Security operatives kill eight bandits in Plateau   
Ibrahim said the terrorists, who were in large numbers, carried sophisticated weapons opened fire on anyone in sight immediately they got to the villages.
He stated, “They came to our village around 2pm on Saturday and immediately opened fire on anyone they came across.  
“I was lucky to escape to Bingi village, because they did not see me as I was hiding behind one of the trees in the village, but one of my children was killed.”
Ibrahim added that the two villages were currently deserted as the residents had fled to other places for safety.
He also said apart from the 62 persons kidnapped during the attack, there were over 50 persons at the terrorists’ camp, who were kidnapped some weeks earlier.
Another indigene of the Bukkuyum Local Government Area of the state, Mohammed Isa, said the terrorists killed 20 persons in Ganar-Kiyawa village on Sunday.
According to Isa, the bandits invaded Ganar-Kiyawa village around 9am and killed 20 persons and wounded many others.
He said the bandits, who were carrying AK-47 rifles, invaded the village and started shooting in different directions.
In a statement, the Special Adviser to Governor Bello Mattawale on Media, Zailani Bappa, said the governor was deeply saddened by the recent bandits’ attack on some communities in the state.      
Matawalle was quoted to have said the dastardly and cowardly attack was coming at a time when peace was fast improving in the state, adding that it would not deter the efforts of his administration at achieving it.
While condoling with the families of the victims, the governor ordered the Ministry for Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management to immediately release relief materials to victims of the attack and their families.
The Christian Association of Nigeria in Kaduna State condemned the attack, describing it as sad.
The Chairman, CAN in the state, Rev John Hayab, condemned the latest attack and killings in Kagoro without any substantial action from the government and security forces.
The cleric in a statement titled, ‘When will the killing of innocent people in Kaduna stop?’ maintained that citizens of the state were tired of the never ending rhetoric without concrete actions to protect lives and property.
Hayab, who’s also the Vice-Chairman of CAN in the northern states, called on citizens to rise up and protect themselves since the government had failed to do so.
He also called on the state government to swallow its pride and seek genuine help to end the continued killings in the state.        
Hayab stated, “The Christian Association of Nigeria, Kaduna State chapter, is sad and grieving following the continued killings, kidnappings, banditry and the unimaginable evil going on in our state unabated without any substantial action by the government and security forces.
“One only needs to see how human beings are killed and roasted by bandits, who attacked Kagoro, to conclude that this is one loss too many.
“How long will this evil continue and when will our leaders act dutifully? Kaduna State citizens are tired of the government’s rhetorical responses without concrete action taken to protect lives and property.
“Accordingly, we want to hear and see the killers and kidnappers arrested as the government’s usual media condemnation whenever there is havoc is not good enough.”
He added, “Meanwhile, we appeal to citizens to also wake up and do the needful, protecting their lives and community. When a government fails to protect you, you ought to find a means of defending yourself.
“For the record, Kaduna State has lost several lives in the past four years, while the leaders scarcely show empathy or concern for the victims, seeing that the government’s response is usually in the media. Sadly, the dead cannot read nor listen to the news.”
When contacted on the telephone, the spokesman for the state police command, ASP Mohammad Jalige, did not take his calls and had yet to reply to a text message sent to his mobile telephone by our correspondent as of the time of filing this report.    ,,

The late Plang was said to have been fatally wounded when the assailants, suspected to be kidnappers, invaded Takas village on Friday night.
A resident in the community, Solomon Dickson, told our correspondent on Saturday that the attacker stormed the home of the governor’s aide and abducted his stepmother and a girl.
Dickson added that the late Plang who had been asleep was woken up by the noise in the compound and was attacked when he came out to see what was going on.
 
“It was last night (Friday) that the gunmen came and attacked the house of Diket Plang, who is a special adviser to the governor. When they (kidnappers) arrived at his house in Takas that night, the governor’s aide was not in the house at the time. So, they broke into the apartment where his stepmother and a young girl staying with her were sleeping and abducted them.
“So, the step-brother, Fwangshak Plang, who was woken up by the noise in the compound from another apartment where he was sleeping came out to know what was happening. The kidnappers, on sighting him, attacked him and wounded him badly.

13th March 2022,Russian troops abduct second Ukraine mayor,"A Ukraine mayor was abducted by invading Russian forces on Sunday, the second such kidnapping in days, bringing strong condemnation from the European Union.
“The army of the Russian Federation captured the mayor of the city of Dniprorudne,” in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast region of southeast Ukraine, the regional administration head Oleksandr Starukh said on Facebook.
On Friday the mayor of southern Ukraine’s Melitopol was kidnapped by Russian soldiers occupying the city, because “he refused to cooperate with the enemy”, according to the Ukraine parliament.
“The EU strongly condemns the kidnapping of the mayors of Melitopol and Dniprorudne by Russian armed forces,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a post on Twitter.
 
“It is yet another attack on democratic institutions in Ukraine and an attempt to establish illegitimate alternative government structures in a sovereign country,” he added.  Related News   UN 'deeply concerned' over Russia, Ukraine's summary executions of prisoners  China 'hasn't yet' delivered arms to Russia, says Biden  EU hammers out €‎2bn ammunition plan for Ukraine   
European Council President Charles Michel also condemned “in the strongest terms Russia’s indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Ukraine as well as Russia’s kidnapping of the mayors of Melitopol and Dniprorudne and other Ukrainians. “These kidnappings and other pressure on Ukrainian local authorities constitute another flagrant violation of international law,” he added.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Saturday on the leaders of France and Germany to help secure the release of the mayor of Melitopol.      
“During the night and today, we are talking to our partners about the situation with our mayor. Our demand is clear: he must be released immediately… I have already phoned (German) Chancellor Olaf Scholz. I have spoken to (French) President Emmanuel Macron… I will speak to all the necessary people to get our people released,” Zelensky said in a video released by the Ukrainian presidency.

1st October 2021,"Declaring bandits terrorists: Reps, ACF, CNG back Senate, 27 abducted in Sokoto fresh raid","The pan-northern socio-political organisation, the Arewa Consultative Forum, and the Katsina State Government have supported the National Assembly’s call on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to declare bandits terrorising the North-West terrorists.
The National Publicity Secretary of the ACF, Emmanuel Yawe, who stated this in an interview with The PUNCH on Thursday, said activities  of the bandits qualified them to be called terrorists.
The ACF made the call as bandits struck again in the Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State, where they kidnapped no fewer than 27 people, mostly women and children.
The Senate had on Wednesday urged the President to declare bandits in the country terrorists. 
The senators said the President should declare a total war on bandits by ordering the  bombing of their locations.
On Thursday, the House of Representatives made a similar call.
Chairman of the House Committee on Defence, Babajimi Benson, at the plenary on Thursday, moved a motion of urgent public importance,  urging  the chamber to back the Senate.      
It was titled, ‘Declaration of bandits and their sponsors   terrorists.’
The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila,  asked for those who were against the motion but the lawmakers chorused, “No!”
The motion was unanimously adopted through voice vote.
Moving the motion, Benson said, “The Senate, on Wednesday, 29th September, 2021, adopted a motion asking President Muhammadu Buhari to declare bandits ravaging the northern part of the country terrorists and wage a total war on them. They also asked that the President declare all known leaders of bandits wanted and arrest them wherever they were found for speedy prosecution. Such declaration to be done through a Proscription Order can be done pursuant to Section 2 of the Terrorism Prevention Act, 2011 (As Amended).”
Commenting on the call by the National Assembly, the National Publicity Secretary of the ACF, Yawe, said, “We support  the call of both houses. The atrocities committed by these people qualify them to be so called.
“In fact, we think they wish to be so called. We do not see any reason why they continue to terrorise Nigerians the way they have done.  Why kidnap secondary schoolgirls and rape them for years running?

27 abducted in Sokoto
Meanwhile, a resident of Gatawa, a community in  the Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State was killed when bandits abducted 27 people from the community on Wednesday.
This latest attack came six days after the terrorists invaded   Burkusuma camp ,a  joint military base in the local government area
The member of the state House of Assembly representing Sabon Birni East Constituency,  Sa’idu Ibrahim, who disclosed this to one of our correspondents,  said villagers, who escaped to the state capital, confirmed this latest development.      
Ibrahim,  stated, “I was reliably informed by  some of those, who were fortunate to escaped  that no  fewer  than 27 people, mostly women and children were abducted and whisked away to unknown destination by the bandits.
“From the report, I gathered that the bandits were  targeting security formations in the area. They are now looking for where security operatives are  because their morale was boosted by their recent attack on a military formation at Dama, where many soldiers, policemen and civil defence officers were killed.
“They shot two persons, including a woman and burnt three others who hid in a grain store. One of them died instantly while the other two are receiving treatments in the hospital.
“They invaded Gatawa because of the presence of Operation Puff Ader camp in the area. As I am talking to you now, many policemen are still missing. We don’t know whether they were abducted or ran away,” he said.
The state Commissioner for  Security Matters, Colonel Garba Moyi (retd), whose house was recently set ablaze in the  neighbouring Isa Local Government Area of the state, neither picked  nor responded to several  telephone calls put across to him.
Twenty- four hours after the attack, the state police command had yet to react. When contacted, the command spokesman,  Sanusi Abubakar, said he was in a meeting. He  had yet to get back to our correspondent, as of  the time of filling this report.

9th September 2021,We abducted ex-gov Dariye’s father to share in his money   – Suspect,"The Inspector General of Police Intelligence Response Team, led by its Commander, DCP Tunji Disu, has arrested an eight-man gang which allegedly abducted and killed Pa Dufwan Dariye, father of a former Plateau State Governor, Joshua Dariye.
The senior Dariye was kidnapped in June 2020 and after eight days, his decomposing body was found in the bush close to his village in Horop, in the Bokkus Local Government Area of Plateau State.
The kidnappers reportedly collected N10m ransom before killing the 93-year-old.
But the gang leader, Jethro Ngusen, aka Baba Mai-Tuwo, said Dariye was killed “by mistake.” 
Speaking at the Force headquarters on Wednesday, where he was paraded alongside his gang members, Ngusen said, “I didn’t plan to kill Baba Dariye, but the mistake has been made. What I planned was just to kidnap him and extort money from his son, Joshua.
“We are neighbours from the same village, Horop, in the Bokkus Local Government Area of Plateau State. Joshua spent eight years as a governor and another eight years as a Senator, but never assisted any of us his neighbours.
“Much as we tried to ensure he helped, he just didn’t want to help. That was why I decided that I will ensure that I get my own share of his money.”      
Giving an account of how the deceased was abducted, the suspect explained that he hired some men to abduct the nonagenarian.
He said, “I contacted some guys and they in turn got some Fulani kidnappers to help abduct Baba Dariye.
“My boys took him to a forest where we negotiated the ransom.  We were eventually given N10m. Although I didn’t plan to order my boys to kill him, but all I can ask for now is forgiveness for his death.  As I said earlier, it was just a mistake. I only planned to collect ransom from his son. Please, forgive me.”
Other members of the gang are Abubakar Mohammed, 18; Ya’u Sadu, aka Ya’u Kaban, 40; Titus Ezekiel, 35; Dauda Isah, 30; Sunday Ibrahim, 35; Mangwat Shumwar, 30; and Henry Amos, 35.  Others are said to be at large.  Related News   Police arrest killers of ex-Gov Dariye's father  We’re still searching for Dariye’s father – Police   
Shumwar, who claimed to have shot and killed the deceased, said he only carried out Ngusen’s orders.
The Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, cautioned against celebrating criminals who became rich through ill-gotten wealth.
One of Pa Dariye’s sons, who was present at the parade, Dr Haruna Dariye, said he was shocked to hear Mai-Tuwo’s confession.        
He explained that the suspect had denied any involvement in the crime when preliminary investigation pointed to him.
“They didn’t allow my father to die peacefully in his old age. We were contacted by the kidnappers after eight days in their den with N10m ransom paid, that our father had been released. They also told us where to pick him.
“On getting there, we found a decomposing body at the spot. We didn’t know that it was our father’s corpse.
“The kidnappers later told us that the decomposing body was our father’s corpse. This was after we paid N10m ransom.  This is barbaric. We are gravely pained. But we thank God and the Nigeria Police Force for unravelling the mystery,” he said.

31st August 2021,Militants abduct 11 children in DR Congo,"Eleven children aged nine to 17, including five girls, have been kidnapped by presumed Islamist rebels in northeastern DR Congo, a local official told AFP on Tuesday.
The rebels, thought to be members of the Islamic State-linked Allied Democratic Forces, abducted the group in a village in Ituri province on Sunday evening, according to Dieudonne Malangayi, acting chairman of the chiefdom of Walese Vonkutu.
The rebels erupted into the Bundingili area where the village is located, and kidnapped “all the civilians who were there, men, women and children,” he told AFP by phone.
More than three kilometres (two miles) away in the bush, the militants “freed the men, women and some young children,” but kept the 11 other children. 
“We don’t know what happened” to them, said Malangayi, who is also a representative of civil society.
The ADF, historically a Ugandan Islamist group, has been accused of killing thousands of civilians in Ituri and neighbouring North Kivu province.
No fatalities occurred in the latest raid, but “according to our analysis and the testimony of the freed civilians, they abducted these children to train them to become fighters,” Malangayi said.        Related News   
Since May, the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri have been under a state of siege, replacing civilian authorities with army and police officers to fight armed groups.
The ADF, which the United States has deemed a terrorist group, is considered the deadliest of scores of armed militias that roam the mineral-rich eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
On August 18, a contingent of US special operations forces arrived in the area to help the Congolese army in their fight against the ADF, US and Congolese sources said at the time.

4th April 2022,"Gunmen storm Ogun mosque, abduct policeman, two others, demand N15m","Gunmen have invaded a mosque at Soyoye, in the Rounder area of Abeokuta, Ogun State, where they kidnapped a police inspector, Kamarudeen Bello, and two other worshippers.
The policeman was kidnapped last Sunday around 8pm while praying.
Our correspondent gathered that Bello, whose wife gave birth four days before the incident, was the imam of the mosque.
A source said, “After imam was abducted alongside two others, the kidnappers called to demand N5m ransom for the release of each of the victims. But with pleadings and negotiations, the money was reduced. 
“The imam’s wife was contacted with the phone number of one of the kidnapped victims.”
It was learnt that the hoodlums did not know that Bello was a policeman, as he was not in uniform or with any identity when he was picked up in the mosque.
Another source said, “Most of us were scared when they kidnapped him; we didn’t want them to know he is a policeman. If they knew, they might have killed him over fear that he would aid their arrest.”      
Our correspondent learnt that the policeman and others were released before the week ran out after the payment of ransom.  Related News   Two abducted Delta Catholic priests regain freedom  Security operatives arrest three kidnappers, rescue victim  Gunmen abduct 29 from Abuja village

The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the abduction.
However, Oyeyemi said he was not aware of any payment of ransom.
He added that the police would not relent in dealing with kidnappers and other criminal elements in the state.

A victim who pleaded anonymity disclosed to our correspondent, that five of his family members were kidnapped by the terror abductors and that no contact had yet been established.

A resident of the area, Bulus Shemang, lamented that the troubled community was hopeless and devastated over the spate of attacks.

22nd March 2022,"Again, bandits raid Kaduna, Zamfara, kill 62, abduct 62, raze 70 houses","The orgy of violence in the northern part of the country has claimed 60 lives in Kaduna and Zamfara states.
Twenty-five persons, including two military personnel, were reportedly killed, while a riot policeman allegedly shot a passerby and no fewer than 70 houses were razed on Sunday following an attack by terrorists on Agban Kagoro in the Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
The two local governments are in the Southern Kaduna area of the state and share boundaries.
In Zamfara State, bandits killed 37 persons and kidnapped 62 others in Juyi and Doruwa villages in the Bungudu Local Government Area, while 20 others were killed in Ganar-Kiyawa village in the Bukkuyum Local Government Area on Saturday. 
The Kaduna killings sparked protests on Monday as irate youths from the affected area blocked the road and attacked travellers.
It was learnt that a bus was set ablaze during the protest as riot policemen fired into the protesting youths, with a bullet allegedly hitting one of the protesters.
This forced the state government to impose a 24-hour curfew on the Jema’a and Kaura local government areas of the state.      
The Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, who announced this in a statement, said the measure was to allow security agencies to save lives and property, and restore law and order in the areas.
The statement said the government appealed to residents of the local government areas to cooperate with security agencies to restore peace, law and order.
The commissioner quoted Governor Nasir El-Rufai to have condemned the violence that left many dead and property destroyed.
The statement titled, ‘KDSG declares 24-hour curfew in Jema’a and Kaura LGAs’, read, “Following advice from security agencies, the Kaduna State Government has declared a 24-hour curfew in Jema’a and Kaura local government areas with immediate effect. This is to assist the security agencies to stabilise the situation in the areas, save lives and property, and enable the restoration of law and order.
“A statement from the Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs said the security agencies had full authorisation to enforce the curfew. The government appeals to all residents of the Jema’a and Kaura local government areas to cooperate with the security agencies in the urgent task of restoring peace and upholding law and order.
“The government condemns the violence and all acts of lawlessness that have occurred in the area.”
The District Head, Kukum community in the Kagoro Chiefdom, Mr Jashua Kagoya, who narrowly escaped the attack, said the terrorists invaded the community in a military van with sophisticated weapons and took vantage positions.        
According to him, the villagers retired home after their normal activities when they suddenly heard gunshots around 8pm and they had to flee the community.
Kagoya stated, “As you can see, my personal house is completely razed down, but I thank God that my family members and I were able to escape the attack.
“It is very sad that such carnage has been meted out on the peace loving people of Kagoro. We condemn this act in totality and we’re calling on the government to rise to its primary responsibility of protecting lives and property.”
The district head disclosed that 23 corpses had been recovered, while a search was on for others.
The Wakilin Yanmma of Kagoro Chiefdom, Mr Yanshen Sunday, said when he heard gunshots, he contacted the Commandant of the Operation Safe Haven, who promised to respond immediately, which he did.
Sunday said, “While we were trying to figure out what was happening, I saw two military vans and thought the military men came to defend our community, but to my greatest surprise, they were the attackers.
“Before we knew it, the whole place was on fire. We have recovered 23 dead bodies, but I cannot ascertain the number of houses burnt down.      
“While some youths were reacting to the killings, a riot policeman was alleged to have shot dead a passerby, which escalated the tension in the Jema’a Local Government Area.”
A resident of the community, Mr Derek Christopher, said the terrorists came in large numbers in military vans, buses and motorbikes.
He stated, “Two military officers were killed by the attackers.
“Before now, a lot of locals could not access their farmlands for fear of being killed. We’re calling on the government to immediately deploy security in the Agban community to ensure that the people are safe.”
An indigene of the Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Sani Ibrahim, told one of our correspondents that the terrorists, who rode on motorcycles, attacked Juyi and Dorawa villages of the Kekun Waje around 2pm on Saturday and killed 17 villagers and kidnapped 62 others.  Related News   El-Rufai’s auspicious alert on bandits, terrorists  Bandits’ attacks force Plateau pupils out of school  Worst of insecurity is over, says FG   
Ibrahim said the terrorists, who were in large numbers, carried sophisticated weapons opened fire on anyone in sight immediately they got to the villages.
He stated, “They came to our village around 2pm on Saturday and immediately opened fire on anyone they came across.  
“I was lucky to escape to Bingi village, because they did not see me as I was hiding behind one of the trees in the village, but one of my children was killed.”
Ibrahim added that the two villages were currently deserted as the residents had fled to other places for safety.
He also said apart from the 62 persons kidnapped during the attack, there were over 50 persons at the terrorists’ camp, who were kidnapped some weeks earlier.
Another indigene of the Bukkuyum Local Government Area of the state, Mohammed Isa, said the terrorists killed 20 persons in Ganar-Kiyawa village on Sunday.
According to Isa, the bandits invaded Ganar-Kiyawa village around 9am and killed 20 persons and wounded many others.
He said the bandits, who were carrying AK-47 rifles, invaded the village and started shooting in different directions.
In a statement, the Special Adviser to Governor Bello Mattawale on Media, Zailani Bappa, said the governor was deeply saddened by the recent bandits’ attack on some communities in the state.      
Matawalle was quoted to have said the dastardly and cowardly attack was coming at a time when peace was fast improving in the state, adding that it would not deter the efforts of his administration at achieving it.
While condoling with the families of the victims, the governor ordered the Ministry for Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management to immediately release relief materials to victims of the attack and their families.
The Christian Association of Nigeria in Kaduna State condemned the attack, describing it as sad.
The Chairman, CAN in the state, Rev John Hayab, condemned the latest attack and killings in Kagoro without any substantial action from the government and security forces.
The cleric in a statement titled, ‘When will the killing of innocent people in Kaduna stop?’ maintained that citizens of the state were tired of the never ending rhetoric without concrete actions to protect lives and property.
Hayab, who’s also the Vice-Chairman of CAN in the northern states, called on citizens to rise up and protect themselves since the government had failed to do so.
He also called on the state government to swallow its pride and seek genuine help to end the continued killings in the state.        
Hayab stated, “The Christian Association of Nigeria, Kaduna State chapter, is sad and grieving following the continued killings, kidnappings, banditry and the unimaginable evil going on in our state unabated without any substantial action by the government and security forces.
“One only needs to see how human beings are killed and roasted by bandits, who attacked Kagoro, to conclude that this is one loss too many.
“How long will this evil continue and when will our leaders act dutifully? Kaduna State citizens are tired of the government’s rhetorical responses without concrete action taken to protect lives and property.
“Accordingly, we want to hear and see the killers and kidnappers arrested as the government’s usual media condemnation whenever there is havoc is not good enough.”
He added, “Meanwhile, we appeal to citizens to also wake up and do the needful, protecting their lives and community. When a government fails to protect you, you ought to find a means of defending yourself.
“For the record, Kaduna State has lost several lives in the past four years, while the leaders scarcely show empathy or concern for the victims, seeing that the government’s response is usually in the media. Sadly, the dead cannot read nor listen to the news.”
When contacted on the telephone, the spokesman for the state police command, ASP Mohammad Jalige, did not take his calls and had yet to reply to a text message sent to his mobile telephone by our correspondent as of the time of filing this report.    ,,

13th March 2022,Russian troops abduct second Ukraine mayor,"A Ukraine mayor was abducted by invading Russian forces on Sunday, the second such kidnapping in days, bringing strong condemnation from the European Union.
“The army of the Russian Federation captured the mayor of the city of Dniprorudne,” in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast region of southeast Ukraine, the regional administration head Oleksandr Starukh said on Facebook.
On Friday the mayor of southern Ukraine’s Melitopol was kidnapped by Russian soldiers occupying the city, because “he refused to cooperate with the enemy”, according to the Ukraine parliament.
“The EU strongly condemns the kidnapping of the mayors of Melitopol and Dniprorudne by Russian armed forces,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a post on Twitter. 
“It is yet another attack on democratic institutions in Ukraine and an attempt to establish illegitimate alternative government structures in a sovereign country,” he added.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Saturday on the leaders of France and Germany to help secure the release of the mayor of Melitopol.      
“During the night and today, we are talking to our partners about the situation with our mayor. Our demand is clear: he must be released immediately… I have already phoned (German) Chancellor Olaf Scholz. I have spoken to (French) President Emmanuel Macron… I will speak to all the necessary people to get our people released,” Zelensky said in a video released by the Ukrainian presidency.

The Kogi State Police Public Relations Officer, William Aya, said the command had yet to be briefed about the incident.
He, however, promised to reach out to our correspondent after getting information on the incident.

15th February 2022,Woman disguised as teacher abducts five children in Rivers,"Five children were abducted by a woman from their homes after she disguised as a teacher in the Rukpakulus axis of Eliozu in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.
Three children aged between 18-months and four years old were said to have been kidnapped from one family and two others snatched from another family.
The mother of the first three abducted children, Rose Monday, told newsmen in Port Harcourt that the woman took her children when they went over to their neighbours to play.
Monday said the woman had disguised as a home lesson teacher looking to rent a makeshift structure in the area. 
The devastated woman further said her children were last seen after the woman took them to buy notebooks, saying they never knew that she had a hidden agenda.
She explained, “I was at home when one of my children who was playing with her siblings came back alone. I asked her the whereabouts of her brothers’. She said one aunty (woman) said she will bring them home.
“I asked where the woman had taken them to and she replied that the woman took her to Oil Mill (a popular market in Port Harcourt) to start taking them on lessons and she and the other children followed her.      
“They (children) were seven including one of my neighbour’s children. She said the woman told her to go that she has given her money for transport, that she will bring her brothers to the house.”
Mrs. Monday’s 14-year old daughter who was initially abducted by the mystery woman narrated how she (woman) let her and their neighbour’s son off around the Oil Mill market axis, but went away with the other five children.
The teenager said, “I told the aunty that the small one (child) don’t know how to write by herself and the woman can go and buy the books.
“The woman said no, that she likes little children. As I followed her, she started watching me. When I returned the looks, she smiled.

“She now stopped a vehicle and all of us entered. When we got to Oil Mill, the woman kept me there and sat down.
“The woman now told me she wants to take the children to go pick up something. So, I sat there for a long time.
“I then asked a girl operating PoS if she knew where the woman took the children to and the girl replied that she didn’t know the woman.”        
The mother of the other two children, Blessing Emmanuel, said the mystery woman had hired her husband to buy materials to construct a makeshift structure before she kidnapped her children.
“So this woman told the children that she organises lessons (home classes) and that if she sees a way, she will begin lessons for them. So the grown-up child said, ‘Aunty let’s go and buy books’.
“Since I know the girl and her brothers’ who usually come to my house to play with my children because she was a former neighbour, I allowed my children to follow them,” she explained.
When contacted, the acting spokesperson of the state police command, Grace Iringe-Koko confirmed the incident, describing the parents of the abducted children as careless.
She said, “Those people (parents) were they not careless? Somebody came to you that she is a teacher, went to their house and told them she wants to take the children and buy books for them.
“They allowed her to take the children. Is it supposed to be like that? So, you can see that it is the carelessness of parents and they will now fall back on the police.
“We (police) have commenced investigation to ensure that the children are rescued, as well as arrest the woman and make her face the law.”      
She, however, advised parents to be vigilant and report suspicious characters coming around their children in whatever disguise to the police or raise the alarm where necessary."

5th February 2022,"Bethel pupil rejected freedom, ransom bearer abducted – CAN chairman","THE Chairman of the Christian Association in Kaduna State, Rev John Hayab, has raised the alarm over the abduction of one of its members sent to deliver the ransom for the release of the remaining kidnapped Bethel Baptist High School pupil by terrorists.
Hayab, who’s also the Vice Chairman of CAN in the northern states and Abuja, also disclosed that the remaining pupil, said to be the youngest of the abductees, rejected an offer of freedom from the terrorists.
According to the President, Baptist Conference, Rev Ishaya Jangado, 121 pupils were kidnapped by bandits in the early hours of July 5, 2021, at the school premises along the Kaduna-Kachia highway, Damishi, in the Chikun Local Government Area of the state
The bandits had released 120 of the pupils in batches. 
However, the CAN chairman said that the teenager preferred to remain with the bandits, a development that puzzled the entire members of the Baptist family and indeed, CAN.
Hayab explained that the bandits were said to be showering the boy with gifts each time they went out and come back from operations, thereby, making him reject the offer of freedom.
The CAN leader, who spoke to Saturday PUNCH in Kaduna on Thursday, said, “Only one pupil of the Bethel Baptist High School is remaining with the terrorists. The reason is that this young boy – because we have to be clear with the story so that we don’t get misquoted – is the smallest among them.        Related News   PICTORIAL: Sadness, joy as freed Kaduna Baptist students reunite with families  15 Kaduna Baptist students freed by bandits  VIDEO: Bandits release 28 abducted students of Bethel Baptist High School   
“I think the kidnappers were smart. They worked and changed his mind that he even said he wants to stay with them. They (terrorists) gave him meat, good things. Anytime they go out and come back, they pick him among the rest and give him so many things and then he starts acting funny.
“If they (terrorists) tell him to go home, he would say he was not going and gave some flimsy excuses that his parents used to beat him at home. But we also made findings and we don’t want to expose his parents to any noise but that is what he (the pupil) said. We are confused too.”
“But I understand they (terrorists) are playing mind games with him by giving him gifts and convincing him to talk that way. But last week, they (terrorists) asked us to bring some money (ransom) to come and take him. The person who took the money to them was kidnapped. The person is with them as I speak now (on Thursday).
“So, it’s a very complicated situation that we are praying and managing with care. The man who has been helping us to deliver the money (ransom) all this while went to deliver the money to free this boy they were confusing and they kidnapped him. So, the whole thing is taking a different dimension and we need to be careful.”

The abductions and killings were carried out between Friday and Saturday in the communities.
This is just as the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), directed the nation’s armed forces to embark on a major military operation to end killings and kidnappings in the state.
The Vice-Chairman of Kontagora Local Government Area, Aliyu Makiga, who confirmed the attack on Farin Shinge community, said the gunmen stormed Tegina in large number to carry out the attack. 
“They kidnapped a lot of people; some have been released while others are still with them,” he said.
Makiga revealed that the gunmen have demanded for seven 50 litres gallons of fuel, packs of Viju Milk and other drinks as ransom for the abductees from the Farin-Shinge community.
“They are demanding for ransom of seven 50 litres gallons of petrol, Viju Milk and other drinks,” he said.      
Another group of gunmen were said to have attacked Jigawa, Dogo Fadama and surrounding communities, killing two people while four others were abducted.
According to a resident of Jigawa community, Umar Mohammed, the gunmen conducted a house-to-house search, rustling cattle and abducting people.
Mohammed said although the attack took the community unaware, majority of the residents were able to escape when the gunmen arrived.
In Kulho community, the gunmen began the attack at about 3.30 pm and ended the operation at about 6pm.
A resident named Tanko Kulho was shot dead and 16 people were abducted while shops were looted and over 18 motorcycles stolen by the gunmen.
A resident in Kulho, Abdulrahman Adamu, who confirmed the attack, said six of his family members, including his three elder brothers, were among those who were abducted.

But Buhari has directed the nation’s armed forces to embark on a major military operation in Niger State.
The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday titled ‘President Buhari sets the ball rolling for a big military operation in Niger State.’
He said Buhari has directed the military to respond “robustly” to the attacks.
He said, “In a directive to the Defence Headquarters a few days ago, the Commander-in-Chief of the nation’s armed forces asked the military to respond robustly to the cases of killings and kidnappings in the state and to give effect to the strategic objectives through the use of force.      
“In his message to the government and people of Niger State, President Buhari said, ‘I would like to express sincere sympathies to the government and people of the state following recent security incidents.’”
Buhari reiterated that security is a responsibility of every member of the community and only through solidarity and cooperation with law enforcement agencies can the nation defeat the problems finally.
“The Federal Government is willing to strengthen support and cooperation with all the states. I believe that with the full cooperation of the citizens, we will surely overcome this problem,” the President was said to have added.
Political leaders’ assurances leave more to be desired –Kaigama
Meanwhile, the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja Diocese, Ignatius Kaigama, on Sunday expressed fears over the challenges facing the country, saying Nigeria has become a nation of uncertainties.
He noted that the assurances of political leaders and security operatives in the face of insecurity always leave more to be desired.
The cleric made his position known in his sermon delivered at St. Andrew’s Parish, Orozo, Abuja.  
Kaigama said, “Unfortunately, we have become too uncertain about many things; unsure each day about what will become of our people if they go to the farms or streams, what may befall villagers at night, or even in broad daylight in the cities, where people get abducted in exchange for cash.
“In Nigeria, we seem to transit from one major national challenge to another. We witness the criminal activities and mindless killings such as the recent attacks in Zamfara State, and efforts by terrorists to establish themselves as a government within a government, yet, the assurances of political leaders and security operatives always leave more to be desired.”

The 75-year-old Mota said six children and four others, who came to assist in the harvesting of farm produce, were killed in a terrible manner, adding that their hands were tied to their backs before they were shot.
When contacted, the state Commissioner of Police, Monday Kuryas, confirmed the incident but said the command had yet to ascertain the actual number of people killed during the attack.
He added that security personnel had been deployed in the affected communities to restore normalcy.        
In Plateau State, a youth leader in the Ncha community, Nuhu Bitrus, confirmed the killing of 17 persons to The PUNCH in Jos on Wednesday.
Bitrus said that the gunmen, who carried out the attack, also burnt several houses belonging to the residents, while several persons sustained injuries.
According to the youth leader, the attack on the community took place in the early hours of Wednesday and lasted for several hours.
He said, “We have a disaster currently in one of our communities in Ncha. Some gunmen, whom we know to be Fulani, last night invaded the community and started shooting everywhere and killing anyone they saw in sight, while setting people’s houses on fire. Right now, we have counted 17 dead bodies and six persons that were injured during the invasion, which started around 2.30am.
“The Ancha community is the same place that one person was killed just a few days ago by the same people. We don’t know what to do before the government and security agents will see the need to protect our people from extermination, which obviously is the intent of the attackers.”  Related News   Terrorists attack Burkina Faso villages, kill 44  Katsina residents collaborating with terrorists – CP Nadada  Buhari’s security guards killed in ambush buried

“The troops responded swiftly and mobilised to the village. On reaching the community, the attackers had fled the village. Houses were destroyed and some villagers lost their lives during the attack.
“Troops of Operation Safe Haven are on the trail of the assailants and details of the pursuit will be made available later.
“The Commander, Operation Safe Haven, Maj Gen I. S. Ali, while commiserating with the families of those who lost their lives during the attack, reiterated his resolve to ensure that the perpetrators of evil on the Plateau face the consequences of their dastard acts.”  
Lalong demands arrest as invaders gun down 18 in fresh Plateau community attack
Meanwhile, Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has expressed deep sadness over the attack on Acha village.
Lalong described the attack as another sad tale in the unending cycle of violent attacks in the area, which had continued despite several measures taken by the government.
According to the statement signed by Lalong’s Director of Press and Public Affairs, Macham Makut, the governor ordered security agencies to ensure that they fish out the attackers at all costs, “as bringing such perpetrators to justice is the only way to halt the barbaric killings.”
Makut stated, “The governor asked the GOC, 3rd Armoured Division and Commander, Operation Safe Haven; the Commissioner of Police; Department of State Services; Operation Rainbow; and other security organs in the state to utilise intelligence available from survivors and other sources and ensure that the perpetrators of this and other attacks are apprehended and exposed.
“While commiserating with the families of those killed and the survivors, the governor directed the Plateau State Emergency Management Agency and the Peace Building Agency to move in and assess the damage as well as offer immediate humanitarian interventions.
“Meanwhile, the governor has praised security forces for busting a kidnap group and rescuing some victims in Barkin Ladi, describing the action as heart-warming and proof that criminals would not be allowed to rest in Plateau State.
“He directed further investigation and arrest of the fleeing suspects for prosecution, promising that those found guilty would face the law, which prescribes death penalty for convicted kidnappers.”

Most of the killings and abductions happened in the northern part of the country.
On January 1, bandits killed one and abducted 12 persons in Kaduna, while the wife and daughters of a lecturer in Zamfara State were also abducted on New Year Day. 
On January 4, gunmen killed three in Plateau State and a bride-to-be was also abducted in the state on the same day.

It’s not enough to have manpower; if we do not have a comprehensive intelligence and security approach to tackling kidnapping and banditry, then we may never end the menace.”

4th January 2022,"We abducted Anambra monarch, burnt palace to take over community oil – Suspects","Some  suspected members of a kidnap gang have said they abducted the traditional ruler of Ogwaniocha community in the Ogbaru Local Government Area of Anambra State, Igwe Oliver Nnaji, to take over the oil proceeds of the community.
Nnaji was kidnapped on November 15, 2021, when gunmen invaded his palace at midnight and razed the building.
But the Special Forces of the Nigerian Naval Base, Onitsha, raided the Ochan forest camp of the hoodlums at 1.20am on Friday, killing 10 of the suspects and arresting five of them.
During interrogation on Monday, one of the suspects, Victor Ibenegbu, aka Network, 32, said his group was behind the serial killings and arsons in the community. 
He said, “We abducted the Igwe because he did not allow us to control the oil proceeds in our community. Because we wanted to be in charge of the proceeds, we formed a group called ‘Lion squad’ headed by one Okwudili, who is a native doctor in the community, but he is based in Asaba and comes through the river near the forest to meet us.
“Each time we are to carry out an operation, he prepares charms for us, and a young girl carries the charm in a calabash naked around the forest. We stormed Igwe Nnaji’s palace on November 15, 2021, kidnapped him and burnt down the palace.
“We first kept the Igwe in one of the buildings in the community until at night when our leader directed us to move him to the forest. Right now, I don’t know where the Igwe is because our leader took him away and since then we have not set our eyes on him.”      
Another suspect, Egbuna Anyakoha, said he overhead their leader telling a member that the monarch had been beheaded.

The 36-year-old said the gang leader who recruited them promised to pay them N1m every month to join him in fighting the community over the control of the oil proceeds.
“The leader of the Lion Squad tried to install himself as igwe but he was resisted because there is an igwe. It was in his unsuccessful bid to install himself as igwe that he formed the squad,” he added.
The leader of the naval team that carried out the operation, Suleiman Agabi, said the suspects were arrested based on intelligence, adding that his men swooped on their hideout and engaged them in a gun battle.
“They go to communities around the borders, kidnap their traditional rulers and force the communities to dance to their tunes. They kidnap the rulers and use the ransom to buy guns, prepare charms and maintain their operations,” Agabi added.
Among the items recovered from the suspects were live ammunition, cartridges, guns and charms.

1st January 2022,"Secondary school leaver abducts Lagos pupil, collects N550,000 ransom","A kidnap suspect, Ayobamidele Ayodele, has been apprehended by the police for the alleged abduction of a six-year-old pupil of a private school in the Ojo Alaba area of Lagos, Ebube Eze.
Ayodele, who reportedly collected N550,000 ransom from the victim’s family, was said to have been tracked down in his father’s residence at Mowe, Ogun State, days after he released the boy.
City Round learnt that 23-year-old Ayodele went to the school around 9am on November 6, 2020 and posed as a parent trying to make enquiries on requirements for enrolling a child in the school.
While he was waiting at the school gate, he reportedly beckoned Ebube and tricked him into following him somewhere on a motorcycle. 
It was gathered that the suspect contacted a teacher in the school whose phone number he collected in the course of making the enquiry and demanded to speak to Ebube’s father.
After the boy was released, the father, Afam Eze, reportedly petitioned the Inspector-General of Police, Baba Usman, attaching the abductor’s phone number. The case was consequently referred to the Force Intelligence Response Team led by DCP Tunji Disu.
Afam, who resides at Ojo Alaba, told the police that the abductor called him and demanded N200,000, adding that he negotiated and paid N150,000 into a bank account with the name Ayobami Kudus Ayodele.      
He said he and some members of the family were waiting at Ajangbadi junction where the suspect had promised to release Ebube when he received another call from Ayodele, demanding N2m with a warning that he should pay the ransom on time if he wanted to see his son alive.
After negotiating for four days, the family reportedly transferred N400.000 to two bank accounts provided by the suspect and Ebube was released.
 Our correspondent learnt that Afam, who added Ayodele’s number to his WhatsApp’s contacts, saw a photograph on his (the suspect’s) display picture section and showed his son, who confirmed the image was that of his abductor.
“The IRT detectives at the South-West annex were able to track down the suspect in his father’s house at Mowe. He confessed to the crime and took police to the lounge where he kept the boy for four days. The lounge manager said they were worried when he stayed with the boy for days but he claimed that he was the father of the child,” a police source said.
Ayodele, a secondary school leaver, told the police that he learned kidnapping in Nigerian movies, claiming that he lured Ebube out of the school on the pretext that he would buy him gifts.

He said, “I used to hustle at Alaba International Market. I decided to try out some of the methods used to kidnap children and adults in movies. I started by visiting several schools around Ojo to see the possibility of picking children without anyone noticing.
“I decided to try my luck on November 6. I visited one school close to Alaba International Market and stayed by the gate. I saw a teacher passing by and she asked me what I was doing there. I was about to respond when she asked if I wanted to register my child in the school. I said yes and she told me to wait.        
“She came back a few minutes later and gave me a form. She also gave me her phone number and asked me to return with the child in January. As soon as she left, I hung around a bit and noticed two kids coming to the school. The boy was holding a cane. I took the cane from him and he told me he bought it on his way to school.
“I asked him to drop his bag in the classroom and come back to show me where he bought it. I whispered into his ears that I was going to buy many things for him and told him not to tell his sister. He agreed. He went inside, dropped his bag and came out.”
He said he convinced Ebube to mount a motorcycle and they headed for Alabarago junction.
He stated, “I gave him my phone that had a lot of games in it and he was so excited. I immediately called that teacher and told her that I abducted a pupil. I asked for N200,000 ransom and they begged to pay N150,000. I sent an Access Bank account to the child’s father and he paid the money.
“I felt that I could get more money from the family since N150,000 was easy for them to pay. I took the boy to another area called Magbon and demanded N2m from the father. I bought ice cream, chicken and other things for him and assured him that I would take him back to school.”
To avoid suspicion, he said he asked the boy to call him daddy as he took him to the lounge in the Ilogbo Eremi area of Lagos, where they lodged in for four days before the family paid N400,000.
He added, “The boy stayed calm except once when he told me that his mummy would be angry that he came home late. I assured him that it was his parents who asked me to take him along. I made sure he had access to my phone and he played the available games. I am so sorry that I caused the family much pain. My parents trained me well. I was just impatient and greedy.”

28th December 2021,"Endangered species: Fear grips Imo traditional rulers, prowling gunmen kill two monarchs, abduct five in one month","CHIDIEBUBE OKEOMA writes on the incessant killing and abductions of traditional rulers in Imo State
Abduction and killing of traditional rulers have taken a centre stage in Imo State of late. These have made many monarchs in the state flee their kingdoms and the state.
Within a period of one month,  gunmen killed two monarchs and kidnapped five others.
For example, gunmen on December 14 kidnapped the traditional ruler of Umuezeala- Ama ancient kingdom in the Ehime Mbano Local Government Area of Imo State, Aloy Igwe. 
The monarch was kidnapped at Nkwo Umuezeala market while he was discussing with his kinsmen.
A source in the area said,   “Eze Aloy Igwe of Umuezeala- Ama kingdom has been kidnapped. He was kidnapped on Tuesday evening at the Umuezeala market square. Some guys stopped and ordered him to join their vehicle. The monarch obeyed and since then his whereabouts have remained unknown.”
On December 13, two traditional rulers, Acho Ndukwe and Paul Ogbu from Ihube communities in the Okigwe Local Government Area were kidnapped and their palaces razed.      
While Ndukwe was rescued 24 hours later, Eze Ogbu was later found dead when security operatives raided a criminal den in the Orlu Local Government Area.
On December 9, the traditional ruler of Mbutu ancient kingdom in the Aboh Mbaise LGA, Damian Nwaigwe and his counterpart from Atta ancient kingdom in the Njaba LGA, Edwin Azike, were kidnapped separately.
While Azike was kidnapped and his corpse dumped at the market square in his community, Nwaigwe was freed two days later.
On November 19, the traditional ruler of Achi Mbieri in the Mbaitoli LGA, Henry Madumere, was kidnapped at Iho in the Ikeduru LGA while on his way to a public function.
The octogenarian monarch, who is the father of a former deputy governor of the state, Eze Madumere, was let off the hook of his abductors six days later.
Earlier on October 19, the traditional ruler of Etekwuru autonomous community in the Ohaji-Egbema LGA, Kenneth Okereke, escaped assassination. But his attackers burnt his palace and official vehicles after he escaped.
Also on the same day, gunmen invaded the Njaba LGA council headquarters located at Nnenasa and opened fire at traditional rulers.        
While two traditional rulers died on the spot, two others went into a coma and were rushed to an undisclosed hospital where they were resuscitated.
On April 7, gunmen abducted Eze Charles Irogebu of Umuezie community in Nguru- Aboh Mbaise LGA and his cabinet chiefs.
The monarch, who was freed days later, was returning to his palace after attending a traditional marriage ceremony at the Ehime Mbano LGA when his abductors double-crossed his convoy, kidnapped him and his cabinet chiefs.
The development had caused panic in the state. Moreover, the video footage circulating online which showed how some kidnappers were dehumanising some abducted traditional rulers had generated public outcry.
Many residents of the state have continued to condemn the abduction and killing of monarchs.
One week after the kidnap of Eze Aloy Igwe, nothing has been heard of him. This development has generated fear in his family and the kingdom.
The President General of Ohanaeze Youth Council, Igboayaka Igboayaka, said that kidnapping and killing of kings in the state were abominable in Igboland.      
The youth leader said, “The apex youth socio-cultural organisation of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Ohanaeze Youth Council, has described the recent onslaught on traditional rulers, particularly the recent abduction of two monarchs as an abomination and a sign of decline of Igbo norms and value system.
“As the National President of Ohanaeze Youth Council, I say that the circumstances of formation of Eastern Security Network have made some political opponents in the state to unleash terror on the people to sabotage the present government in Imo State.
“The council regretted that the victims, Eze Acho Ndukwe of Amagu Ihube, Eze Paul Ogbu of Ihitte Ihube, both in the Okigwe Local Government Area of the state, have become victims of a failed Igbo society.
“The council decried the manner in which the gunmen whisked away the royal rulers, unfortunately the gunmen also burnt their palaces and vehicles. This is sacrilege in Igbo land,” Igboayaka lamented.
“It seems that the lives of traditional rulers in Igbo land are in danger. Just on Thursday, December 9, the traditional ruler of Atta ancient kingdom in the Njaba LGA, Edwin Azike, was kidnapped and killed on Friday with his corpse dumped at the market square.
“It’s on record that the traditional ruler of the Mbutu ancient kingdom, Eze Damian Nwaigwe, was kidnapped on Thursday and released on Saturday.
Also, the National President of Igbo National Council, Chilos Godsent, said that the abduction and killing of monarchs in the state were dangerous to the growth of the state and its economy.    Related News   Imo monarch mourns ex-dep gov, Ebere Udeagu  Kidnapped Imo monarch escapes from abductors' den  Imo monarch's kidnappers demand N200m ransom   
The activist said, “The Igbo National Council worldwide has observed the reckless and mindless kidnap and murder of traditional rulers in Imo State in the recent times.
“Th INC notes that it’s alien in Igbo for gunmen to murder in cool blood ordained traditional rulers. We, therefore, condemn the act in its totality.
“Consequent upon the above, INC, therefore, calls for the restructuring of the security architecture in the South-East.”
An indigene of the state, Orie Martin, said “The simple fact is that the incessant attacks clearly demonstrate the failure of security agencies, particularly the police and the DSS (Department of State Services.
“Now, the monarchs killed lived in their autonomous communities. Before the killers carried out the killings, they held meetings. They communicated, that is they made calls. If there was well placed intelligence, the security men would have got a wind of it and act accordingly. Even if they were not prevented, after the act, it would not have been difficult apprehending the culprits and that would have served as a deterrence as the killers would be afraid of being caught.
“Thus, the blame goes squarely to the police, and to Governor Hope Uzodimma who has failed to restructure the security architecture of the state. For instance, when you encounter three to five youths in a vehicle, do the police question them?”.
The interim president of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Wing, Jones Onwuasoanya, said  “This is another evidence that some extraneously motivated or brainwashed terrorists have invaded Igbo land. No Igbo true born would think of harming the custodians of our tradition, the holder of the community’s ofo – the symbol of authority and spiritual powers.      
“No matter what the grievances might be, the truth of the matter is that the way our government is structured, these traditional rulers have little or no powers to bring about any reasonable change in the system. They are being targeted because they vulnerable because they can easily be picked up, when compared with political officers, who are guarded by well armed security agents, but these traditional rulers either do not have the financial muscle or connection to have even armed security personnel. Except maybe, the so-called first class traditional rulers.
“ I think some people or a group of people are trying to send a message by harassing these traditional rulers. But that message is an evil message, it portends danger for Ala Igbo and I will continue to plead with my fellow youths and anyone involved in these mindless atrocities to sheathe their swords.
“If they are being used by politicians, they should sit back and understand that it is their own future that they are ruining, not the future of these politicians. Beyond the fact that the law will definitely catch up with them, they should also consider the spiritual implications of these atrocities. You do not spill the blood of innocent people, no matter what may be the justification. This blood will haunt them and everyone connected to them. The curses of our fathers whom they made to pass through this trauma won’t elude them.
“First and foremost, we are the Igbo, before being any other thing; be it Nigeria or Biafra. We are first of all the Igbo, and we have our traditional spiritual beliefs and practices. We have what is called Nso Ana. A taboo, an abominable act. Those killing our traditional rulers or killing any innocent Igbo person in the guise of any agitation are evil people, whom we hope shall quickly repent and turn away from their evil ways and if they don’t, they shall meet very bad ending.
“Politicians, whether in power or in opposition must take responsibility, they must stop giving tacit support to the activities of these hoodlums and rather work hard to douse the tension in the land. It is suspicious when politicians keep quiet or tacitly express joy while the State is being destroyed. Every responsible political, religious, sociocultural leader must dude to the occasion.”
Another resident of the state, Jude Owuamanam, said” it is very worrisome that a revered institution in Igbo land is under attack. It is worrisome because no one knows where these attacks are coming from and the motives.
The Chairman of Human Rights Defenders, Imo state chapter, UgoGold Ofondu, described the development as a sacrilege.        
He said “the attack, abduction and the killing of some Traditional Rulers in Imo State in recent time, is nothing short of a sacrilege. The act itself is repugnant, reprehensible and utterly condemnable.
“No matter the grievances of the young people who are perpetrating these heinous crimes, nothing can justify the brutish nature of their actions.
“I am deeply saddened over the rising state of insecurity in Imo State in particular, and in Nigeria in general.
“And I call on every well-meaning Imolites particularly the political class, to rise up in condemnation of this despicable wave of attacks on our once revered Traditional Institutions and the custodians of the people’s culture and tradition.
“I beckon on the Youths of Imo State to always toe the path of peace in addressing whatever wrong that had been meted out to them
“They should bear it at the back of their minds that whatsoever one sow, one must reap.
“And as the Military/Police option is not yielding the expected results, the Imo Government should equally tinker with prospect of engaging Imo Youths in a roundtable discussion to ascertain what the problems are exactly. We have suffered enough. Imo needs peace now.”      
The police spokesperson in the state, Micheal Abattam, said that the security agents were not resting on their oars in making sure that the state is safe for everybody, including the traditional rulers.
The governor of the state, Hope Uzodiinma, said that his administration would support security operatives in the state to stamp out criminality in the state.
He assured that those who were arrested in the Orsu LGA and Lilu in Anambra State in connection with the abduction of two traditional rulers and killing of Eze Ogbu and a youth leader in Okigwe would be made to face the full wrath of the law.

27th December 2021,Gunmen abduct two on Christmas Day in Ekiti,"Gunmen allegedly struck again at Ijan Ekiti in Gbonyin Local Government Area of Ekiti State on Christmas Day and abducted two men.
This came about 48 hours after a chief in the community, Emmanuel Obafemi, was abducted from his farm to an unknown destination by armed men suspected to be kidnappers.
Sources on Sunday identified the victims of the Christmas Day abduction a cocoa merchant and a commercial motorcyclist.
They were said to be on a motorcycle when they were ambushed by the gunmen at about 5.30pm. 
One of the sources said the abductors were yet to contact the relatives of the two victims for ransom as of Sunday evening.
This was as family sources said on Sunday that the abductors of the traditional chief had contacted the family and demanded N20million ransom.
A family source said, “They (kidnappers) have called to ask for the huge amount of money before they can set our brother free. The amount is so exorbitant, and we don’t know how to source the fund. It is a sad Christmas for us”.

“We heard about the latest incident on Christmas Day and I can tell you that we have begun operation to rescue the victims and arrest the perpetrators,” Komolafe said.
He said security agencies were not aware of demand for ransom for the kidnapped chief and advised residents of the community to volunteer timely and useful information that could help to secure the release of the victims.
Although state Police Public Relations Officer, Sunday Abutu, could not be reached on Sunday, he had on Friday said security agencies were on the trail of the kidnappers of the traditional chief.

Ireyomi was abducted while returning to Sagamu, Ogun State, from Zamfara State en route the Auchi-Benin way.
His vehicle was abandoned by the roadside, while he has not been seen since then.
The family’s petition, titled, ‘A case of kidnap of Mr Adedeji Ireyomi of Transport Service Ltd, along the Auchi-Benin way by unknown kidnappers,’ and dated November 30, 2021, was signed by a lawyer, Olushola Abisoye, on behalf of the family. 
It said Ireyomi was employed in 2014 by TSL and was one of the company’s professional drivers.
The petition disclosed that after the driver was whisked away, his kidnappers reached out to the family and demanded a ransom of N3m.
The company was alleged to have asked his wife to negotiate with the criminals.      
The family stated, “The kidnappers established contact with the family on the same day whereby they equally reached out to our client’s co-workers, precisely Mr Saheed, who in turn informed one Mr Korede with a promise by both drivers to find a solution to this matter, though they failed.
“At this juncture, our client’s wife, Mrs Temitope Ireyomi, on October 24 met the chief security officer of the company, who informed her that the kidnappers were demanding N3m and asked our client’s wife to negotiate with the kidnappers for N300,000 and our client’s wife did as she was instructed, but the kidnappers refused to accept the offer.”

“Following this development, our client’s wife forwarded the above text message to the CSO as well as the head of human resources and they both promised to resolve this issue. But eventually, the CSO denied being aware of the matter and warned our client’s wife to stop telling people that he was aware of the matter,” the petition added.
After the threat from the suspected kidnappers, the family claimed that the company retrieved its truck from the police and abandoned Mrs Ireyomi to her plight.
The TSL Chief Security Officer, Adegboye Akinlawon, declined to comment on the case.        
He said, “I cannot discuss it on the phone because it is a security matter.

24th November 2021,"Herdsmen abduct Neighbourhood Watch chairman’s daughter, demand N15m  ransom","Gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen have abducted the eight-year-old daughter of the Chairman, Agu-Amede Community Neighbourhood Watch Group, Mr Sunday Olinya, aka Sunday Sharia Driver.
Agu-Amede community is in the Isi-Uzo Local Government Area of Enugu State and shares boundary with Benue State.
The community has witnessed several herdsmen attacks, including a series of abductions for ransom.
Our correspondent gathered that the recent incident occurred on Sunday when the herdsmen, numbering about seven, stormed Olinya’s house with AK-47 rifles. 
After he escaped, the gang kidnapped his daughter, Nmesoma, after ransacking the house and carting away valuables.
Olinya, who confirmed the attack and the abduction of his daughter on Monday in a telephone interview with PUNCH Metro, said he had reported the incident to the police and some detectives had visited his house twice.
He said, “I was sleeping around 1am on Sunday when I heard a bang on the door. I was sleeping in the living room; immediately, I woke up. I heard the second bang. I stood up and asked who was there, but I got no response.      
“I went close to one of the windows and looked outside. I saw two Fulani herdsmen with AK-47 rifles positioned to shoot. I rushed to the backdoor and saw two herdsmen equally positioned with their AK-47 rifles. All the light in the house was off, but the security lights were on and my wife and children were still sleeping in their rooms.
“So, the only option available since there was no network to call for assistance was to find a way to escape. Luckily for me, there was one window in the house that had no burglary-proof bars and I had to escape from there.”
He noted that the assailants, on noticing that he was fleeing, shot in his direction, but he escaped unhurt.
“In order not to attract much attention, they broke one of the windows and went inside the house. They ransacked everywhere, collected some valuables, including money and my wife’s phone and kidnapped my eight-year-old daughter, who was sleeping.

“My wife told me that they looked for her as she overheard them asking my daughter where her mother was. According to her, when they heard the shooting, she and my son woke up and went to hide inside one of the rooms, but my daughter was still sleeping in her room,” he added.
Olinya noted that his family established contact with the hoodlums through his wife’s phone, saying they demanded N15m for her release.
He said, “They told a family member, who is in constant contact with them, that they came to kill me and not to abduct my daughter, and that I had an unfinished business with them.        
“What I know is that my community asked them about a month ago not to come to destroy our farm crops. This happened after they destroyed with their cows about 50 hectares of rice farms in Akpouf Agu-Amede.”
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Daniel Ndukwe, confirmed the attack and abduction of the girl, but denied that the hoodlums were Fulani herdsmen.
“Meanwhile, a full-scale manhunt for the assailants and rescue of the victim has since commenced,” he added.

21st November 2021,Gunmen abduct five Chinese mine workers in DR Congo,"Gunmen killed a police officer and kidnapped five Chinese nationals working at a gold mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s conflict-plagued east on Sunday, military sources said. 
Regional army spokesman Major Dieudonne Kasereka said that “at around 2 am, the camp of the Chinese group was attacked by armed bandits” in the village of Mukera in Fizi territory of South Kivu province.
“There were 14 in total, five were taken away by the attackers to an unknown destination,” he said, adding that the other nine were safely evacuated.
Colonel David Epanga, head of the armed forces in Fizi, said one policeman was killed and another was wounded in the attack. 
The five abducted Chinese workers were employees of a company that has been operating a gold mine in the area for four to five months, Fizi civil society head Lusambya Wanumbe said.
“The company had difficulties starting its activities because of protests by the population which accused it of not respecting the rules,” Wanumbe said.
In August, South Kivu authorities suspended the work of half a dozen Chinese-financed companies, after residents accused them of mining for gold without permission and wrecking the environment.

The ICCN said the attack was “carried out by around a hundred heavily armed individuals” near the village of Bukima, in the Mikeno area.
“The presumed perpetrators are former M23 members gathered on the Rwandan and Ugandan borders, who are seeking to establish bases on the territory of the Virunga National Park,” the ICCN said in a statement on Sunday.
The M23 is one of more than 120 armed groups which roam eastern Democratic Republic of Congo — a legacy of regional wars more than two decades ago.
It is a Congolese Tutsi group that was largely defeated in 2013 after launching a rebellion.
The militants were accused of attacking army positions close to the park and the Ugandan border on November 8, which the group’s leadership denied.
The Virunga National Park, a UNESCO listed world heritage site, is home to endangered mountain gorillas — particularly in the Mikeno area.

18th June 2021,"Bandits overpower cops, abduct scores in Kebbi federal school","• Gunmen kill policeman, cart away students, four others in two vans
Bandits struck in Kebbi State again on Thursday when they kidnapped scores of students and four others at the  Federal Government College Birnin Yauri.
A teacher in the school, who spoke to The PUNCH  on condition of anonymity,  said most of the kidnapped students were in the Senior Secondary School one and two.
It was gathered that a teacher, a vice-principal, the school security officer and a wife of a teacher were together with the students taken to an unknown destination in two Hilux Pick-Up vehicles by bandits who killed a policeman. 
Sources told one of our correspondents that kidnappers in their large numbers, armed with sophisticated weapons stormed the school on Thursday.
One of the sources stated, “The kidnappers invaded the school at 10am and killed one security agent attached to the school and injured a student.
“The kidnappers in their large numbers overpowered a team of mobile policemen that attempted to repel the attack.      
“Shortly after the gun battle with the police, the kidnappers broke into the school and whisked away some students and four others in two Hilux vehicles to an unknown destination.
“Following the attack, the whereabouts of at least three staff members and a wife of a teacher have yet to be ascertained.  The school is still collating the number of abducted students.”
The Press Secretary to the Emir of Yauri, Mallam Ibrahim, who confirmed the incident to newsmen on the phone,  said, “The kidnapper stormed the school and kidnapped both females and male students.
“The principal of the school just called the palace and told His Royal Highness what actually happened. We cannot ascertain the number of students yet,” he added.
The state police command spokesman, Nariu Abubakar, in a  statement quoted the state Commissioner of Police, CP Adeleke Adeyinka, as condemning the attack.
He stated, “The commissioner of police has assured parents and guardians of students that the command is following credible leads and intensifying efforts to track the assailants and ensure the rescue of the missing students and teachers.
“A combined team of police operatives from the police mobile force, anti-kidnapping and counter-terrorism units are currently combing nearby forests, routes and suspected hideouts of the criminals.”        
As of the time of sending this report at 7pm on Thursday, the state government had yet to react to the incident. A Government House source disclosed that the state Governor, Senator Atiku Abubakar Bagudu, travelled out of the state.
Efforts to speak with the Special Adviser to the Governor on media, Mallam Yahaya Sarki, did not yield any result as several calls to his line could not connect.
But the lawmaker representing the Igaski/Shanga/Yauri  in Kebbi State at the House of Representatives, Yusuf Sununu, lamented the attack.
Sununu, who addressed journalists in Abuja on Thursday, warned that the growing insecurity in Kebbi  State was a major threat to food security in the country.
Sununu said the pervading insecurity in the country was becoming worrisome, saying, “gone are the days when Kebbi used to be the most peaceful in the country.

 Last week 300 bandits with AK47 operated for eight hours in my constituency – Rep      
“A week ago, we had another calamity when bandits – according to eyewitnesses – numbering about 250 to 300, each with an AK-47 rifle and using very strong motorcycles, came into my constituency. They had a field day and operated for more than eight hours, going (from) house to house, room to room, collecting money, handsets, motorcycles and cattle. That led to a massive influx of internally displaced persons to the headquarters of the emirate in the town of Yauri.
“However, we were able to convince people and they started going back to their respective areas. But they (bandits) left a message that they would be coming back. Taking it seriously, some people refused to go back and in the early hours of today, they repeated what they had done earlier, and they came into the constituency, somehow around 10:30am or thereabout. They were able to gain access after strong fights with some security guards and policemen guarding the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, and they made their way into the school. They succeeded in kidnapping some teachers and an unaccounted number of students. Some of the students and security men are currently receiving care at the General Hospital Yauri following gun injuries.
“This is a cause for concern and as representative of the people, I had to come here and make a call on the Federal Government to look at Yauri’s position with its neighbouring Niger State. It has direct access to Zamfara State and west of Yauri is back of River Niger. Our fear is that their major target is to enter Yauri. Now, we are calling on the Federal Government to provide adequate security. I have got in touch with security agencies. We had discussions and it has been confirmed to me that military aircraft are in surveillance in the area.
 “We have to make it clear that Kebbi State and indeed Yauri holds a unique position in the food security of this country. Over 90 per cent of the land of Yauri is for rice farming. But as of today,  no farmer can comfortably go back to his farm and farm and come back to sleep with his eyes closed.
“We are right now facing an influx of a number of people into Yauri with a higher rate of internally displaced persons. Accommodation, feeding and other logistics that are necessary are being affected. The worst part of it is that a nation can only develop when it is sound educationally wise.
“The so-called Boko Haram is almost becoming a reality because parents cannot feel free to send their wards to school for fear of being kidnapped. As it is now, a lot of primary schools in the emirate in Yauri town are being occupied by IDP. This has a tendency to deter the progress so far achieved by the Kebbi State Government in terms of agriculture and in terms of promoting access to education.
 General Hospital turned into IDP camp–Rep  
“The healthcare is also being stretched because of the influx of people. The only General Hospital we have is being occupied by IDPs. So, we are in a state of disarray and definitely we have to call on the FG so something can be done immediately to safeguard the lives and property of our people.”
 Police plan surveillance in schools  
The Nigeria Police Force said it had deployed undercover operatives for surveillance and intelligence gathering around vulnerable schools across the country.
The Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, disclosed this in an interview with The PUNCH on Thursday.
Our correspondent had asked him what the force was doing to make schools safe and to rescue those abducted.
He said, “We are working with the Federal Government and other stakeholders to implement and actualise the Safe School Initiative programme.
“We are taking advantage of our community policing programme to mobilise host communities where these schools are situated to collaborate with law enforcement agencies in providing real time surveillance for these schools.      
“We are implementing high visibility policing patrol system around schools across the country by deploying more personnel and assets for both foot and motorised patrols.”
“We are deploying a huge number of undercover operatives for surveillance and intelligence gathering around vulnerable schools.,” he said.

14th June 2021,936 students abducted from Nigerian schools in six months,"At least 936 students of secondary and tertiary institutions were abducted by suspected bandits and Boko Haram members across the country between December 2020 and June 5, 2021.
Findings by our correspondents showed that abductions were carried out across the country.
During the period under review, abductions were recorded in Ohordua, Edo State; Effurun, Delta State; Kankara, Kaduna State; and Mahuta village, Katsina State.
Other places where cases of abduction were recorded are Kagara, Niger State; Jangebe, Zamfara State; and Afaka, Kaduna State, among others. 
Some parents who spoke to our correspondents said they would not allow their children return to school.
One of them, Alhaji Ibrahim Bageba, whose children were among the kidnapped Jangebe schoolgirls, said, “I have decided to withdraw my children from school because of the security situation in the whole country.
“Our children are no longer at ease due to rampant cases of student abduction across the country and as such, I feel that it is better to withdraw my children so that I will have peace of mind.”      
A mother of two of the students who were abducted by bandits during the Jangebe School abduction, Hafsat Sani, said, “Many parents are skeptical about the government’s readiness to fight banditry. As such, I don’t think my children will return to school.
“Two of my children were kidnapped; I will not allow them go back unless something tangible is done.”
The Director of Press, Ministry of Education, Bem Goong, told The PUNCH that the Federal Government was working hard to ensure that schools were safe.
He urged state governments to also do the same.  Related News   Two abducted MAPOLY students, others regain freedom  Hasten release of kidnapped students, group urges FG  Freed students, teacher to reunite with families today   
Goong said, “If you go to our unity schools, you will notice the presence of security operatives. During the 2021 Common Entrance Examination monitoring exercise, the permanent secretary also added that unity schools are the safest and it is because we have deployed security operatives there.”
The Zamfara State Government said it would close down boarding schools till security situation improved in the state.
The state Commissioner for Education, Aliyu Tukur, said, “A committee has been constituted to look into the possibility of reopening the boarding schools that are not prone to attacks by bandits. We have deployed security operatives in schools that are open and we have organised workshops for school principals.”        
A security expert, Nnamdi Chife, called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to resuscitate the Safe School Initiative.
Chife said, “The government of President Jonathan designed a security strategy called Safe School Initiative, which was meant to provide comprehensive security for the schools that were under attack by the Boko Haram.
“It is high time for this administration to resuscitate that security programme to provide safe corridor for students. Otherwise, we may lose a generation.”
Another expert, Olalekan Ojo, said, “School abduction is becoming worrisome and some of us have been calling for a national security summit on this issue. A national security summit will involve school owners, security experts and other stakeholders.”
Ojo said if nothing urgent was done, the number of out-of-school children in the country could increase to about 30 per cent of the student population.

2nd April 2021,"Bandits invade Niger joint forces camp, kill seven, abduct 10","Bandits have allegedly killed seven persons, including five soldiers, in the latest attacks on communities in the Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State.
The bandits were said to have abducted over 10 persons, stole seven motorcycles and burnt down military vehicles during attacks on Wednesday and the early hours of Thursday, which left the villagers confused and scampering for safety.
The communities include Allawa, Manta, Gurmana, Bassa and Kokki, all in the Shiroro Local Government Area of the state.

The PUNCH learnt that the bandits stormed the camp of the Joint Security Task Force comprising the Army, police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and vigilantes around 2am on Thursday at Allawa and opened fire on them, killing five soldiers and one NSCDC operative, while many sustained varying degree of injury.
Eyewitness said the bandits attacked Manta, Gurmana and Bassa villages on Wednesday, where they killed one Alhaji Sale in Madalla under the Bassa ward, and kidnapped four persons and went away with two motorcycles.
Confirming the incident, the President, Shiroro Youth Movement/Chairman MHWUN-SHLGA in Bassa, Gurmana and Manta, Mohammed Sani Idris, said the bandits, numbering about 100 and armed with AK-47 rifles, attacked the communities for about five hours unchallenged.      
He stated, “During the invasion, they killed one Alhaji Sale in Madalla community under Bassa ward and kidnapped four people and made away with two motorcycles.
“Also, in Kokki Boddo a community under Gurmana ward, they abducted six persons and took away five motorcycles; five persons were also kidnapped in the Manta ward.”

Idris appealed to both the federal and state governments to double up their efforts in ensuring the security of lives of the residents of the various communities.
When contacted, the Co-convener, Concerned Shiroro Youths, Sani Kokki, told our correspondent that five soldiers and one NSCDC operative were killed in Allawa by bandits, who attacked their camp in the early hours of Thursday.
“The criminals took the personnel of the Joint Security Task Force unawares and opened fire on them. In the process, they successfully burnt down the camp to ashes, including operational vehicles, and also gruesomely killed about six personnel (five soldiers and one civil defence officer), while many others sustained various degrees of gunshot injury.”
He explained that Allawa, before the attack, was one of the few towns standing in the Lakpma area of the local government that had not been invaded in the recent past.        
Lamenting the rate of attacks by bandits in the area, Kokki said, “We, the affected victims, view this phenomenon from the angle of ethnic cleansing as we have been abandoned to our fate. As a result of sheer negligence from the authorities constitutionally saddled with the responsibility of providing adequate security to the citizenry, there is deliberate effort by criminals through crude means to depopulate us, which from all indications they are coasting to their target.”
However, efforts to get the reaction of the state police command failed as calls put across to the Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, rang out as of the time of filing this report.

1st April 2021,Gunmen abduct two Chinese farmers in Ogun,"Unknown gunmen have abducted two Chinese from their farm in Oba town in Obafemi-Owode Local Government a few hours before the state governor, Dapo Abiodun, inaugurated the state’s wing of the South-West Joint Security Outfit known as Amotekun.

21st December 2020,My daughter was abducted and murdered during end-of-year party closing prayer — Father of two-year-old Ebonyi girl,"Mr Sylvia Ufiem-Nnachi is the father of a two-year-old pupil, Miss Rosemary Ufiem-Nnachi, who got missing at an end-of-year party she attended with her parents on Saturday, December 12 in Obeagu Aba village in the Ebonyi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, while her body was found floating in a river on Monday. In this interview with EDWARD NNACHI, the father shares his pain
How did the incident that led to your daughter’s disappearance happen?
My name is Sylva Nnachi. I am from And Eke village, Ekoli Edda community in the Afikpo South Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. I am 44 years old. I am the father of Miss Chinyere Rosemary Nnachi, the two-year-old child that was abducted on Saturday during an end-of-the-year party of my club at Nnodo community.
My daughter was abducted on Saturday, December 12, 2020 and was later found dead in the river on Monday afternoon. She was abducted at a party, which all of us, including her two elderly siblings and her younger sister attended at Nnodo in the Ebonyi Local Government Area of the state. The abduction happened between 6pm and 7pm. Rosemary was two years and five months before she was abducted and killed. The programme had ended and it was during the closing prayer that she was abducted. 
Everybody stood up for prayer, only for us to end the prayer and it was discovered that the little girl was missing. Of course, as were standing and praying, the height of older people, who were standing in front, covered the children, who were behind them. It could be at the time when we were praying that the abductor came in from behind and took her away. So, as we finished praying, we couldn’t see her again and we started looking for her.
The most unfortunate aspect of it all is that while the search was going on, a member of the club, who also attended the party, was busy distracting and disrupting the search party. This particular member of the club was busy distracting those who were searching for my daughter to the extent that he engaged me in a fight and bit off my left ear. You can see that my left ear is off now. As a result, he ended up distracting those who were looking for the girl. What was my offence? My offence was that security men and members of the Ebonyi State Neighbourhood Watch approached the venue to search for my daughter, but the man insisted that they must not conduct the search because a preliminary search had been done and there was no point doing the same again.
He insisted that the search must not take place. As the father of the missing girl, I protested and said he had no right to stop the security men. He said I shouted at him and engaged me in a fight. And I told him that what he was doing was discouraging and disturbing the people and that I wanted my little daughter back. I told him to allow the security men to do their job; but he felt otherwise and slapped me and engaged me in a fight to the extent of biting off my left ear. As expected, the team couldn’t continue the search because of the scene he had created. They arrested him, took every one of us to the police station and we made our statements. I left the police station around 1am on Sunday.      
What do you think could have pushed this member of your club to engage you in a fight to a point of biting off your ear?
To be honest, I don’t know what pushed him to do it. I didn’t have a quarrel with any member of the club, including this particular man. I can’t figure it out, but I think it’s left for the security agencies to unravel the circumstances and truth surrounding the incident.
What is the name of the club?
The name of the club is Club 12 Multi-purpose Society. It was at an end-of-the-year party of the club. However, the party wasn’t supposed to hold if the club members had heeded my advice. I remember that I advised them against this year’s party on two different occasions. I reminded them that we lost a member this year and we were just bereaved and this was in spite of the fact that we lost another member in 2019. One of our members died and was buried in October. I told them that we should cancel partying and merriment this year in honour of our member, who had just been buried. But the club members refused.
I went as far as making reference to our member, who died last year, and we had to cancel the end-of-the-year party for 2019 because of him. Now, losing another member this year, it was fair to cancel the party. Events of this year itself should teach people to be cautious. The year came with COVID-19, #EndSARS and other negative things. I told them that we needed to play safe. I never knew that the party I suggested shouldn’t hold, which eventually held, was targeted at my family, so much that my daughter was kidnapped and eventually killed. So, I think it’s also left for the security men to investigate this matter and unravel what really happened.
Did you have quarrels with anybody before the incident?
I can’t say I had quarrels with anybody. I didn’t and everybody knows me as a man of peace and justice. In fact, what people call me is Nwa Amuru Affia Enyioha (the great friend of all, who was born in the market). So, I couldn’t imagine having an issue with anybody that could warrant the abduction and eventual killing of my daughter.        
Where did this ugly incident take place?
Where we had this party is called Obeagu Aba village, Nnodo community, in the Afikpo South Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. It was in the compound of one of our members, who insisted on hosting this year’s party, because he just finished building the house. This really was against the rule of the house, because we normally hold our events in public places. The last time we held the event, it was held at the cooperative hall of the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki.
Before setting out for the party, did you have any premonition that something untoward might happen?
Yes, it could be that I wasn’t too sensitive to understand the signs God was showing me. I was actually out of Abakaliki three days before the party was held. But because it was an instruction by the club leadership that we had a function and that everybody must attend with their families, I left where I was and started coming to Abakaliki on Friday. As I set out for the journey, the vehicle I boarded had a punctured tyre around 7pm. We got it fixed and got to the new Timber Shade, the one before the Military Cantonment, when the second back tyre on the passengers’ side also got flattened. I got to my house around midnight. I think that was a sign.  Related News   Man, 56, arrested for sexually abusing 11-year-old Ebonyi girl   
Then, the following morning, I rushed to the mechanic to ensure that I picked my car from him so that I could take my family to the party, but the mechanic wasn’t through with the car. I had to take a sister’s car to the event. So, I had these signs that God showed me, but I was not sensitive. In the course of this year, I had this dream that one of my daughters was missing. When I woke up, I told my wife about it, and we prayed. However, we prayed and I ignored it, not knowing that it was something that would take place in the future. As I was driving to the venue of the party, the distance alone should have made me discontinue the journey and turn back home. But I was not sensitive enough.
Do you condemn yourself for being insensitive?
I actually do not condemn myself. I did say I was careless for not heeding these signs that God was showing me before the incident. I should have paused a bit and ponder over these signs and be a little more watchful and careful. So, that’s it.      
Have the club members visited you since the incident?
No, they have not. This incident happened Saturday and from that Saturday till Monday (December 14), when the baby was discovered to have died and found floating on the river and the body was deposited in the mortuary, the club members have not visited me or my wife.
Are you suspecting a conspiracy?
It may not be out of it. I think there is conspiracy in one way or the other. This is because in this tragic incident involving a member of this club, members should have rallied round the bereaved family; even if the men are not disposed, their wives should have come to be with my wife. But it has not happened in this case. And even when a member fought me and bit off my ear and the police arrested him, somebody was busy making sure he was released. A man’s child got missing, a search team came and wanted to help to look for the baby, and someone said they must not do that and in the process bit off my ear. This is another question that requires an answer and it points to conspiracy.
Who was Chinyere Rosemary to you?
Chinyere Rosemary was my second daughter. She was a little lovely baby. At her age, she was jovial and seeing her smile, anger or depression would leave you. As little as she was, she was the unifying one among her siblings. She was a girl who  you would love to stay with. In fact, at the party, it was as if everybody wanted to play with her. It was as if she was the one being celebrated at the party. Jokingly, one of us said she was coming to pay her bride price on behalf of his son and when they grow, they could marry. In reply and jokingly too, I said my daughter would choose her man when she grew. That it is to tell you how people appreciated the girl.
What will you miss about her?  
I want all my children to be with me. She was the closest to the last girl, who is some months old. She was my closest friend. I will miss everything about her. But then, it’s unfortunate and an insult to the authorities that the Commissioner for Internal Security and Border Peace would send a search team to look for a missing child, yet an ordinary civilian would order the security men and civilians that made up the search team not to embark on the search. It’s very painful and unfortunate. The commissioner was to join in the search party, but on getting there, he had a call and it could be a very important call and he instructed that the search should continue. But an ordinary individual upturned his instruction. This question too, will be answered in due course. The little girl could have been found had the search taken place, because the whole thing was still happening within the same vicinity.
Do you think you will ever recover from this?
I don’t think so. This is really too much for me. This is the second death that has kept me wondering and shivering. The first was the death of my mother, which left me so emotionally and psychologically crippled and again, Chinyere Rosemary’s death. This is too much to bear. I can’t recover from it. These two deaths are tragic for me. If God chooses to comfort me and my family, let Him do so.
What are you asking the authorities to do in this circumstance?
I trust the security architecture of this state, comprising the police, the DSS, the Army and others. I know that the police know how to do their job. This is an incident that is so ungodly, so inhuman and that is not a natural disaster, but man-made. Therefore, I want the security agencies to carry out professional investigation to see that justice is served in this matter. It is not about me or Chinyere Rosemary, it’s about forestalling similar incidents in future in the state. This is possible if the police and other security agencies deploy professionalism in their handling of this matter.

16th December 2020,Gunmen abduct 10-year-old boy in Delta,"Matthew Ochei, Asaba
Gunmen have reportedly abducted a 10-year-old boy, Chimeremezie Izu, at No. 5 Kelvin Street, Core Area 4, GRA, Asaba, the Delta State capital.
PUNCH Metro gathered that the young boy was taken away from his mother after the armed robbers who broke into the apartment could not lay hands on cash and valuable items around 3:30 am on Wednesday.
The mother of the boy, Mrs Joy Izu, told our correspondent that she was tied after they saw no reasonable amount of money in the house. 
She said, “The gunmen actually came to rob us but could not find cash and they took my only son away. I was asleep when I heard the sound of something, so I woke up and ran from my room to my children’s room around 3:37 am.
“I saw them and I asked the children what happened, whether something fell down and they said nothing but I insisted that I heard something like a sound. What could that be? So, I heard another sound as I turned, I saw a flash of a torchlight beside the entrance door to my room.
“So, I ran inside my room and started shouting ‘armed robber’, “please help me”. One of them came to the window of my room and asked me to shut up or he will shoot me. So, I ran into the toilet and I continued shouting but nobody came.

14th December 2020,"Suspected ritualist abduct, murder Kogi hunchback","Friday Olokor, Abuja
Tension has gripped Obeiba Ihima community, in the Okehi Local Government Area of Kogi State, following the abduction and murder of a 62-year-old hunchback, Ahmad Suberu, by suspected ritual killers.
Sources in the community told PUNCH Metro that persons with humps had been disappearing in Obeiba Ihima and Ihima Ba in recent times.
Before Suberu, another pregnant woman with a hump was said to have been abducted about two weeks earlier and murdered by suspected ritual killers. 
Suberu, an indigene of Ihima Ba, was reportedly kidnapped on Monday, November 23, 2020, at Obeiba Ihima, while on his way to a mosque for prayers.
His dismembered corpse was said to have been found on December 8 in a bush at Ega community, in the Adavi LGA, with his heart, kidney and other sensitive organs missing.
The Executive Director of Disability Rights Action Group, Raphael Chikwado, and deceased’s daughter, Zuleihat Suberu, confirmed the incident in separate interviews with PUNCH Metro.      
“His hump was taken away, as confirmed from his dead body, which made us to come to the conclusion that it was taken for some odious reasons. From the way we met the dead body, it revealed that he was dumped at Ega some days after being killed,” the 23-year-old only child of the victim said.
Chikwado said, “He was abducted by gunmen in a black SUV while waiting to cross the road leading to Oride Mosque, beside St. Paul’s Church, Obeiba Ihima. An eyewitness reported that the vehicle drove from Okene axis, picked him up and drove off through Ega Road.

“Before his death, the late Suberu was an ardent member of DRAG. DRAG is going to explore every legal avenue within the organisation to pursue justice for the deceased’s family and for the entire community of persons with disabilities in Nigeria.”

13th December 2020,"Bandits who killed my dad came with list of targets, abducted 40 — Zamfara victim","Were you among the worshippers who were recently attacked by bandits during congregational prayers in a mosque in Dutsin Gari village?
Yes, I was in the mosque on that fateful day when the bandits came on motorcycles.
Can you explain how it happened?
Immediately they (bandits) arrived, they surrounded the entire mosque. We were in the second portion of the prayers when we heard gunshots. Some people abandoned the prayers and rushed out of the mosque, while others, including myself, waited until we finished. 
What happened after the prayers?
Immediately after the prayers, the bandits told us to come out of the mosque and follow them to their hideout. Some people objected and wanted to run away. That was why five of them, including my father, were shot dead by the bandits.
So you lost your father in the incident?      
Yes, my father was killed as he was trying to run away.
What is his name?
His name is Muhammadu Sani.
What happened to those who didn’t run away and agreed to follow the bandits to their hideouts?
We were matched into the bush while the bandits kept on telling us that they came to kidnap some people among us for ransom. Their leader told us that they had the list of those they came to abduct. So, they asked us to continue trekking until we were far away from our village before they told us to stop.
Did you see the list?
When we stopped, their leader brought out a list of those they came to kidnap and began to call the affected people. But before the roll call commenced, the bandits’ leader seriously warned that if anyone heard his name and refused to answer, such a person would have himself to blame. As the roll call commenced, they realised that most of the people whose names were included on the list were not around. Even the village head, Alhaji Ibrahim Nabature, who was first on the list, was not around.        
Meanwhile, three out of the five people shot dead were among the people they came to kidnap. Their leader was angry and asked his men who fired the shots to identify themselves.
What happened then?  Related News   Zamfara, security agencies requested telecoms services shutdown – FG  20 killed in Zamfara, bandits attack burial, clash with police  30 bandits, 10 villagers killed in  Zamfara attack   
Immediately they identified themselves, he directed some fellow bandits to shoot them. They were killed in our presence. When they realised that most of those they came to kidnap were not among us, they selected about 40 people who looked wealthy and released the rest, including myself.
How did you feel when you were released by the bandits but you realised that your father was killed?
Sincerely speaking, I can’t explain the situation I found myself in on that day because when the bandits released us, we all rushed home, full of joy. But when I got the information that my father was killed, my mood changed immediately. I cried over the loss of my caring and loving father who is gone forever.
How much did they demand as ransom from each of those kidnapped?
The families of the kidnapped persons are waiting to hear from the bandits, though many people have fled to other towns for fear that the bandits could come back. More than half of the people of this village have run away. The remaining ones you are seeing here are the poorest and the bandits don’t like to waste their time on them because they know that they will not get much as ransom if they are kidnapped.      
Are there other communities facing attacks by bandits?
There are many villages around us also facing a similar problem. For example, some residents in villages like Tiki, Nahuta, Talli, Munkuru and Babu-dama are fleeing to other places because of persistent attacks by bandits. Nobody from these villages can sleep at home. They normally stay in their villages during the day and immediately the sun is set, they run to the bush and hide before returning in the morning.
Now that it is harvest time, do farmers go to their farms to harvest their crops in your area?
The issue of harvest is impossible here because the bandits are all over the area, hunting for people to kidnap. I am telling you, many people will lose their crops.
Is the government aware of your plight?
The government is quite aware of what is happening and to be fair to the governor, he is trying his best on security. The issue is that the bandits know the area more than the security agents who are not conversant with the terrain here. That is why the security personnel are always ambushed and killed by the bandits.
What do you think should be done to address the issue of insecurity in the state?  
As a young man, I think the state government should as much as possible incorporate the youths in the fight against banditry. Some groups, like Yansakai and Yanbanga, should be used by the government to help the conventional security agents who are not conversant with the terrain of our areas. I and other able-bodied young men like myself are ever ready to defend our communities against banditry and other forms of crimes.

29th November 2020,"How gunmen abducted my husband, threatened to kill me –Nasarawa APC chairman’s widow","Can you tell us how your husband was kidnapped?
The gunmen came in their numbers at about 11pm with sophisticated weapons and started shooting indiscriminately into the air and we became afraid and started praying for God’s intervention. When we heard heavy gunshots at the gate, we screamed. All our children were right inside their various rooms. As they (gunmen) entered our living room with their weapons, they shouted, ‘Where is Mr Mose?!’ My husband came out of his inner room and responded to them, saying he was not Mose but the state Chairman of All Progressives Congress.
What did they do next?
I was even holding his hands but they said I should move back, otherwise, they would kill me. They held my only son and wanted to take him away before my husband came out of his inner room. 
Were you able to identify the gunmen?
I had never seen their faces before but they were Fulani men – very tall and slim. They carried their guns, machetes and sticks in their hands. I saw four of them, but others were outside the gate.
What did your husband say to them?      
He asked them what they wanted. But they said all they wanted was for him to go with them. When I refused to leave my husband’s hands, they threatened that if I didn’t leave my husband, they would shoot me. They also asked me to go back and warned me to stop following them. I pleaded with them not to hurt him and they said they were not going to do anything to him. They said they were only looking for a ransom. That was what they told me.

No. They did not mention any ransom. They looked aggressive as if they were going to pull down the entire house. I was scared because I knew it was not going to be easy for us, from the moment we heard the gunshot; we knew that we were already in trouble.
Did your husband have any disagreement with his political associates, family friends or anyone in his village?
I cannot tell because he never shared anything of such with me. We were living our normal lives. Honestly, I feel very bad from the way he was taken away from me. If it were sickness, that one is a different thing. He was taken away in my presence.
What do you want the state government and security agencies to do on this matter?
I want the state government and the security agencies in the state to take drastic actions because if actions are not taken, this may reoccur. The lives of the citizens of the state are at stake. The state government needs to do something serious about it.

Before policemen got to the village, opposite the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Vice Chancellor’s quarters, the kidnappers had escaped with the victim.
The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Muhammad Sadiq, told one of our correspondents, “On Saturday, around 3.30am, information reached the Wamakko Police Division that hoodlums, numbering about 20, went to the Makera Maidoya village, opposite the UDUS VC’s quarters and kidnapped one Bashar Ahmed Maidoya.
“The DPO led a team of detectives to the scene and upon their arrival, it was discovered that the hoodlums had already escaped through the nearby bush.
“Meanwhile, special operatives have been drafted to trail thy fleeing suspects and rescue the victim unhurt as well as apprehend the culprits for prosecution.”      
Sadiq also gave an update on the recent incident at Tudun Mai Tandu in the Dange Shuni Local Government Area of the state, where a robbery suspect was arrested with an AK-47 rifle, two empty shells and live ammunition.
He stated, “The traditional rulers in the area have assisted the police in uncovering three key persons behind the refusal of the villages to hand over the suspect to the police for investigation and prosecution.
“Even, with the intervention of stakeholders, including the Chairman of the Dange Shuni Local Government Council and a former Speaker, Sokoto House of Assembly, the villagers insisted that they would only hand over the suspect to soldiers and not the police.”

28th March 2020,23 passengers from Niger abducted on way to Katsina,"Enyioha Opara, Minna
Twenty three passengers of the Niger State Transport Authority, Minna, travelling to Katsina State have been kidnapped.
Our correspondent gathered that two of the abducted passengers have been released after their families paid a ransom.
It was reliably gathered that the driver followed a route prohibited by the company. 
The passengers who were heading for Katsina on Tuesday evening were ambushed along Jos Road in Plateau state.
One of the freed victims, Emmanuel Ayodele, who was going for an official assignment, said the kidnappers swooped on them after the driver parked the vehicle along the bush area.
He said, “He wanted to buy fuel. We asked him to take us to where there are houses and people but he left us. Few minutes later, we were rounded up and they marched us into a bush path.      
“They seized 23 of us and left those whom they felt may not have ransom to pay. They took our phones and asked us to mention those they can contact to save our lives. I gave my wife’s number and that was how they started the negotiations.

A devastated family member who said her brother was among those abducted said the victim was going to the Federal University Dutsin-Ma, Katsina State to do documentation after securing an appointment.
She lamented, “Since the incident happened, it’s really unfortunate that even the NSTA or the government has not got in touch with us. The kidnappers are demanding N40m but we have been bargaining with them. They said the least they would collect is N30m and we don’t have such amount.”
The state police spokesperson, Wasiu Abiodun, told our correspondent that the incident didn’t happen in Niger.
Abiodun said, “It did not happen within our jurisdiction and we cannot give account of what transpired in another state.’’

A graduate of the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State, Motunrayo Rafiu, who was abducted by suspected kidnappers in the Kabba area of Kogi State, on Tuesday said her abductors were Fulani herdsmen.
She noted that the hoodlums were, however, disguised in army uniform.
PUNCH Metro had reported that Rafiu was abducted on February 4, 2020, while she was on her way to resume at the Abuja campus of the Nigerian Law School. 
It was gathered that when Rafiu could not be reached on her telephone, she was declared missing by her friends, who posted her pictures on social media.
Rafiu, who spent six days in the kidnappers’ den, was released on Sunday after the family paid a ransom of N1m
Narrating her experience with the abductors, the 22-year-old noted that she and other victims were made to walk barefooted in what she described as a wilderness.      
She said, “While on my way to resume at the Nigerian Law School, Abuja, just before Obajana in Kogi State, we saw that some people numbering about 20 in army uniform blocked the road and we thought that they were soldiers on a routine patrol. But all of a sudden, they started shooting continuously and everybody ran for safety. They, however, caught up with us.

“At first, I wondered if they were Boko Haram insurgents or Fulani herdsmen because they wore masks and had sophisticated guns. You don’t have a choice but to cooperate with them.
“Eight people were abducted and we were made to trek into the wilderness. We trekked and climbed rocks barefooted for the six days we spent in their den; we were treated like cows. If you dared to walk behind them, they would flog you as if they were dealing with cows.

“When we got to their base, some of their workers that also rear cows came to greet them and they started dishing out instructions to the workers. I was made to cook food for the rest of the passengers; we were given rice and palm oil to eat.
“I only urinated three times for the whole six days because we had to take permission before we could do anything. While I was there, I believed that I would come out alive; I encouraged the other victims.”
On the ransom, she said, “When they demanded N5m from my family, I told them the situation of things at home and where my mother works so the ransom was reduced to N1m, while others paid N2m and above, depending on their status. No one should go through this kind of experience.”

10th February 2020,"Boko Haram kills 30, abducts many in Maiduguri","Boko Haram terrorists killed at least 30 people and abducted many women and children in a raid in Borno State, a regional government spokesman said on Monday.
The attack Sunday evening targeted the village of Auno on a key highway linking to regional capital Maiduguri.
The jihadists stormed in on trucks mounted with heavy weapons, killing, burning and looting before kidnapping women and children, state government spokesman Ahmad Abdurrahman Bundi said.
They aimed at travellers who had stopped for the night and torched vehicles. 
READ ALSO: Nigerians react as pupil turns ATM gallery light into reading lamp
The attackers “killed not less than 30 people who are mostly motorists and destroyed 18 vehicles,” Bundi said in a statement after visiting the scene.
The attack, some 25 kilometres (15 miles) west of Maiduguri, occurred in an area where fighters from the Islamic State West Africa Province have been active, mounting roadblocks to target security forces and civilians.      
Witnesses said jihadists set alight 30 vehicles in the raid, including trucks that had stopped overnight on their way to Maiduguri.
“Many of the drivers and their assistants who were sleeping the vehicles were burnt alive,” civilian militia fighter, Babakura Kolo told AFP.  Related News   Soldiers kill 54 terrorists, nab 122 suspects  Revisiting the faulty ‘repentant terrorists’ narrative  Boko Haram bomb maker steps on self-made IED, dies   
The jihadists combed through the village, looting and burning shops and property before withdrawing, he said.
Auno lies on the 120-kilometre highway linking Maiduguri to Damaturu, a major regional city in neighbouring Yobe state.
The highway has been increasingly targeted by ISWAP militants in recent months.
The surge has followed the creation of so-called “super camps” by the Nigerian military in the northeast – a strategy under which small army camps have withdrawn from several areas and combined into fewer, larger bases.
Last month four Nigerian soldiers were killed and seven injured when the jihadists attacked troops positioned in Auno.        
The decade-long Islamist insurgency has killed 36,000 people and displaced around two million from their homes in northeast Nigeria.
The violence has spread to neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon, prompting a regional military coalition to fight the insurgents.

Gunmen have abducted a businessman identified as Oga John at Igumale in the Ado Local Government Area of Benue State.
This is coming barely three weeks after a retired Department of State Service officer was seized in the same area.
Our correspondent gathered that the victim (Oga John) was abducted on Saturday around 7:20pm on his business premises located at Camp Junction in Igumale, Ado Local Government Area of the state. 
A resident of Igumale community, Barrister Ochai Onazi, told one of our correspondents on the telephone that the incident happened around 7:20pm when the kidnappers invaded the community through the Adiga-Igumale road and abducted the trader.
Onazi said the victim, who owned the only big supermarket in Igumale, was at the shop transacting business when the kidnappers stormed the place and shot sporadically to scare people.
“As soon as they stormed the area, they shot to the air until the victim was taken away to an unknown destination.      
Onazi lamented that Igumale, the headquarters of  Ado Local Government Area had become a den of kidnappers and other criminal activities. He said there was no day that cases of heinous crimes like kidnapping, armed robberies were not reported in the area. He appealed to security agencies to intervene in the security situation currently confronting the Igumale community.  Related News   
“You remember that it was just last few weeks that Mr Unogwu, a retired DSS officer from Igumale was abducted on his way back from Otukpo.
“Before then, another popular businessman from the area was kidnapped and only released after he paid millions of naira in ransom.
“I appeal to Governor Samuel Ortom to send security personnel to the area. Igumale is fast becoming a safe haven for criminals in the state. This must not continue”, he said
A family source told our correspondent that the abductors were yet to open discussion with the family or demand a ransom.
When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Sewuese Anene, said she was yet to be informed about  the incident and promised to call back as soon as she got details from the Divisional Police  Officer in Ado.

Gunmen suspected to be bandits on Wednesday abducted four Customs officers  along with a   number of motorists at a checkpoint along Jibia-Batsari road   in  the Jibia Local Government area of Katsina State.
Also,  two teenagers  were killed, with  others  injured after another armed gang suspected to be bandits attacked a viewing centre at Magama in the LGA on Tuesday night.
Meanwhile, gunmen reportedly abducted a 14-year-old boy and his mother at the  Juji area of SabonTasha, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State, in the early hours of Tuesday. 
Sources said the  Customs officers were kidnapped   about 10am.
The   motorcycle-riding  gangsters were said to have disarmed the Customs officers before taking them along with the motorists to the forest.
Spokesman for the Nigeria Customs Service in Katsina State,  Peter Duniya, said he was on leave and could not comment on the incident.      
None of the officers contacted at the command was ready to  comment on the issue, although they said they were aware of the incident.

A resident of the area, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the kidnappers scaled the fence of their abductees’ home  before taking the duo  away.        
  The source said when the kidnappers got into the compound after scaling the fence, “they started knocking on the door, ordering the victims to open the door. But when nobody responded, they smashed one of the  windows in an attempt to enter the room.”
He added, “They seized the woman and  as they were going with her, her eldest son who is 14 years old, protested and insisted that he must  be taken along with his mother.
“As I am speaking to you now, the kidnappers  have not said anything and we are very worried since the incident took place over 24 hours ago.”
He further said that the incident had been reported to the Sabon Tasha Police Station but nothing had been done.
 Spokesman for the police in the state, DSP Yakubu Sabo, promised to  contact  the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Sabon Tasha Division and get back to our correspondent. However, as of the time of filing this report he  had yet to respond.

22nd December 2019,"ISWAP fighters kill six, abduct five in ambush","IS-aligned jihadists killed six people and abducted five others in northeast Nigeria Sunday, after blocking a major highway and singling out security officials and aid workers witnesses said.
Around 30 fighters from the Islamic State West Africa Province group took control of the highway near Gasarwa village, 100 kilometres (62 miles) north of the Borno State capital, Maiduguri.
They stopped motorists and demanded their identification.
“They killed six people and abducted five others, including a woman,” Haruna Ashiru, a bus driver whose passengers were among the victims, told AFP. 
“They specifically targeted security personnel, vigilantes, Fulani herders and Christians,” said the driver, who was interrogated by the jihadists but let go.
The militants singled at least six people and killed them, he added. Some of the victims were shot while others were forced to kneel and sliced in the neck.
A policeman, a civil servant and three aid workers were abducted in the attack, Ashiru said.      
One police officer who tried to flee after he was identified was killed after jihadists pursued him in a truck and ran him over, said a civilian militia leader, Umar Ari who also witnessed six deaths.
Three Fulani herders including two women as well as two Christian traders were among those killed, Ari said.
– Civilians increasingly targeted –
Clashes between jihadists and Fulani herders have intensified in recent months, with militants increasingly raiding herding villages to steal livestock.  Related News   Troops kill 19 terrorists in failed ambush  Terrorists ambush soldiers in Abuja, injure three  Soldier, five others killed in Benin Republic ambush   
Last week 19 herders were killed near the border with Cameroon following clashes with Boko Haram jihadists who tried to steal their cattle.
ISWAP have also increasingly abducted motorists at bogus checkpoints in Borno state, targeting security personnel, anti-jihadist militia as well as Christians – a minority in the Muslim majority north of Nigeria.
On December five ISWAP fighters disguised as soldiers, kidnapped 19 people at a fake security checkpoint outside Maiduguri.
Six soldiers and eight civilians, including two Red Cross workers, were among those kidnapped the group said.        
A video released days later showed the execution of two soldiers and a policeman they said were among the hostages.
ISWAP, a faction which split from another jihadist group Boko Haram, initially from mid-2018 focused on targeting military installations and troops.
In recent months however, the group has launched attacks on civilians.
The decade-long jihadist conflict in the region has killed 35,000 people and forced around two million to flee their homes in the northeast.
The violence has spread to neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon, prompting a regional military coalition to fight the militants.

A fashion designer, Joseph Ejiro, has narrated how he was allegedly abducted by some policemen from the Festac Town Police Post and made to pay a ransom before he was released.
It was gathered that Ejiro, who had gone to make a delivery to his client in Festac, was accosted around the Second Rainbow junction on November 21 by one of the cops, who said his boss was waiting in a vehicle to see the fashion designer.
In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Ejiro alleged that he was pushed into the vehicle and beaten by the cops when he refused to give them his phone. 
Ejiro further alleged that he was made to transfer the sum of N185,000 to the account of one of the cops before he was released after spending eight hours in their custody.

He tweeted, “The last few days have been some of the most depressing of my life. I have debated whether or not to talk about this, what the point would be other than rehashing a terrible experience…but the kindness and outrage of friends in the last few days have affirmed for me that I am not crazy or overly dramatic for feeling this way. Violated. Expendable. Afraid.      
“I was kidnapped, beaten, tortured and threatened with death by members of the @PoliceNG. What does freedom mean when policemen can force you into their van, torture you, and threaten to kill you if you don’t pay ransom?
“I was at Festac to make a delivery to a client on November 21. Heading home, a police officer (wearing a police polo shirt with no name tag) blocked my path at the Second Rainbow junction and told me his oga wanted to speak to me. This was around 11am. 
“I asked what the problem was and he said there was no problem, just to come with him. The officer led me to a police minibus parked in front of the petrol station at the Second Rainbow junction. There were seven policemen in police polo shirts waiting in the bus.
“The officers asked what was in my bag, grabbed it before I could respond, and went through it. Money, phone charger, earphones. They demanded that I unlock my phone and give it to them. I asked again what the problem was and why they needed to go through my phone. They repeated their order, crowding me in, and even though I was terrified I refused to hand them my phone until they told me why they wanted to go through my phone. The IG is constantly on television saying that such demands are illegal and ultra vires.

“The police officers pushed me into their minibus and took turns beating me. My cries of pain fell on deaf ears. They handcuffed me and made the cuffs so tight it cut off blood flow and my hands went numb. I was screaming in pain and begging them to loosen the cuffs. They refused and they forced my finger onto my fingerprint scanner and unlocked my phone.
“One of them got behind the wheel, started the bus, and they took me to their station at the 7th Avenue Festac Town Police Post. On the way, they threatened to kill me and dump my body in a ditch, threatened to frame me with the charge of any crime they deemed fit. Having gone through my phone and finding nothing incriminating, they took pictures of me with their phones, putting objects in my hands I could not see and taking snapshots.
“Each time I made to look at the things they were putting in my hands, I was slapped and told to look up at the camera. Then, they started demanding money. 500 thousand naira. For what? I kept asking. What did I do? What was my offence? I kept pleading with them that I did not have 500 thousand naira. I did not have any money. I had done nothing. They should please let me go.        
“The amount kept going down. From 500 thousand naira to 400 thousand naira. They were really just pitying me o. I should just do what I was supposed to do so I could leave. Then they came down to 350 thousand naira and held fast there. Hours had passed.
“Eventually, one of them made me unlock my phone again. He opened my GTBank app on my phone, forced me to unlock the app with my fingerprint, and then they made me transfer N185,000 to this bank account: Ashamo Oluwasola Samuel, Unity Bank, 0040509699.
Lagos CP, Odumosu
“They said this was the only way I was going to be released. Did I want to end up in prison? They had made me transfer all the money I had in my account, leaving behind just N3,500. Apparently, I was supposed to be grateful for their generosity, that they did not wipe me completely clean.
“They took the N5,000 cash I had in my bag, leaving me with the N250 change that was in my pocket. They finally let me go at about 7pm. They had robbed me of my money and my day. I had spent eight hours in their custody. The rest of the day went by in a blur. I could not believe what had just happened to me. I kept saying I had been arrested by the police and they took money from me until a friend corrected me that I was kidnapped and made to pay a ransom. My crime is being a young man going about his business and having the audacity to walk on the road.”
Ejiro, who demanded justice and a refund of his money, said he had reported the matter on the police public compliants WhatsApp line but had yet to get any response.
When contacted by PUNCH Metro, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, asked Ejiro to come to the command headquarters in Ikeja with the details of the incident and promised that the matter would be investigated.

25th November 2019,Three abducted in Boki cocoa farm in C’River,"Ada Wodu, Calabar
Three persons have allegedly been abducted by unknown people from a cocoa farm in Boje, Boki Local Government Area of Cross River State.
According to a member of the community, Charles Kembre, the incident happened on Friday and since then, no contact had been established with the victims.
He said search parties had combed everywhere without finding the missing persons who were in a cocoa farm to fetch bags of the harvested produce. 
Narrating what happened, Kembre said, “One Bekwara man harvested cocoa and hired his brother named Odey Akobi, to bring it home on a motor bike. Two boys, Tiv and Mbube, were to help him lift the bags onto the machine. So the man went the first time and carried one bag. And one and a half bags were left in the bush.
“But the three of them got missing when Akobi went back the second time to lift the remaining cocoa.
“The man who hired him was in a different farm and when he came back, he wondered what kept his brother for that long. So he decided to find out what was wrong. When he got to a spot, he saw the bags of cocoa but did not see the men and their motor bike. He came back and raised the alarm.”      
Continuing, Kembre said, “He came back to the community to report what had happened. The community got people to go into the place to search. In the course of the search, they discovered a pair of trousers and two shirts but didn’t see anybody. The motorcycle was also not found. Our people are wondering what must have happened to those people.
“From that Friday till today (Sunday), we have searched everywhere, yet nothing. At the moment, we have invited the stranger elements from Bekwara and the Tiv people whose boys are missing to a meeting. This morning (Sunday), I reported the incident to the DPO.
“Meanwhile, a group of people came into our farm days earlier and destroyed three to four hectares of cocoa farms. They cut the trees down. It was after that that they kidnapped the three boys.”
When contacted, the State Police Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, said, “I am not aware of the incident. I will find out.”

22nd November 2019,Seven seamen abducted as pirates attack ship in Equatorial Guinea,"Seven crew aboard a supply ship for the oil industry in Equatorial Guinea were kidnapped when “pirates” attacked their vessel, the oil and gas ministry said in a statement on Friday.
The US oil giant ExxonMobil reported the supply ship Warden, which it was chartering from the oil services firm Swire, was attacked on Wednesday in the country’s territorial waters, it said.
The 15-member crew comprised nationals from South Africa, the Philippines, Serbia and Cameroon.
“Eight hid and seven were kidnapped,” the statement said. 
The vessel had left the oilfield of Zafiro, 12 nautical miles off the coast, and was heading to Luba, a port town on the southern island of Bioko, when it was attacked.

The statement gave no details about the kidnappers or their motives.      
Equatorial Guinea is located on the southern rim of the Gulf of Guinea, one of the world’s hotspots for maritime piracy.
In the first nine months of this year, the region accounted for 82 per cent of crew kidnappings around the world, according to the International Maritime Bureau, an organisation monitoring crimes at sea.  Related News   We'll smoke sea pirates out of Nigerian waterways -  Navy  Three men abduct Lagos policeman, destroy N185,000 phone  Police rescue seven abducted children, arrest three suspects   
In 2018, attacks doubled over the previous year.
Pirates in the Gulf of Guinea sometimes divert ships for several days, long enough to plunder the cargo and demand huge ransoms before freeing the crew.
On November 4, four sailors were kidnapped and a guard was shot and wounded when suspected pirates stormed an oil tanker off the coast of Togo.
Two days earlier, pirates attacked a Norwegian-owned ship waiting to berth at the port of Cotonou in Benin, taking eight crew and the captain.
In August, Russia, Chinese and Ukrainian seamen were seized in attacks on merchant ships off Cameroon’s port of Douala.        
The countries bordering the Gulf of Guinea, an arc that stretches some 6,000 kilometres (3,700 miles) from Angola to Liberia in the north, have limited surveillance and maritime defence capabilities.
They have been trying for several years to bolster their means of intervention and improve regional collaboration with US and French help.

Gunmen have abducted six persons, including a nursing mother and her three-week-old baby, from the Hayin Danmani community in the Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
It was gathered that the incident occurred on Tuesday but became known on Wednesday.
Our correspondent learnt that the kidnappers might have revisited the community on Wednesday, with a source saying, “We heard gunshots on Wednesday night and it is possible that the kidnappers came back to the community.” 
PUNCH Metro gathered that the kidnappers had contacted the family of one of the victims and demanded a ransom of N10m.
A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told our correspondent that when the gunmen invaded the community, they shot indiscriminately and moved from house to house to pick their victims.
One of the community leaders, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said fear had gripped the entire area following the abduction of some of the residents.      
According to him, members of the community are now confused and living in fear.
He said while the kidnappers picked the nursing mother and her three-week-old baby, the husband managed to escape.
He added that the kidnappers made away with four other people, who were mostly peasants.
The community leader stated, “The incident actually took place on Tuesday night, but the community discovered the abduction on Wednesday morning.
“We learnt that the abductors made away with a nursing mother and her three-week-old baby.
“You know that the Mahuta, Mando, Rigasa and Danmani communities share common boundaries with Dogon Daji, which lead to Birnin Gwari, where military operation is ongoing. It is possible that the military operation is becoming unbearable for the bandits. So, they are being pushed into these communities.”
As of the time of filing this report, the state police command had yet to confirm the incident as its spokesman, DSP Yakubu Sabo, did not answer his calls and failed to respond to a text message sent to his mobile telephone line.

The kidnappers were said to have invaded the community in their large numbers at midnight while firing indiscriminately.

It could not be ascertained if the police had launched an investigation into the incident as the deputy spokesperson, Federal Capital Territory police command, ASP Miriam Yusuf, failed to provide an update on the abduction.

She also did not respond to inquiries on the new police divisions created to address the worrying incidents by the police authorities.

The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, had last week established five additional divisions in different parts of the FCT to address the rising incidents of abductions.

The divisions are Pegi, Byazhin, Dawaki, Yebu, and Galadima.

The development was a followup to the abduction of over 20 persons within two months in Asokoro, Pegi, Wuse, Dafara, Yebu, and other areas."

Bandits suspected to be kidnappers have abducted five persons, including a school headteacher and  killing one person in two separate attacks on villages in the Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
It was gathered that the bandits attacked Doka village along the Funtua Road on Wednesday afternoon, killing one person (a fuel attendant), abducting two while two others were injured.
Chairman of Birnin Gwari Vanguards,  Ibrahim Nagwari, stated this on Thursday. 
He said the headteacher, Dangamji Primary School, AbdulHafiz Abdullahi, was abducted by the gunmen.
According to him, the bandits also wounded three members of a local vigilance group and kidnapped many travellers from their vehicles in another attack around  Polwaya and Gayam villages  at about 5pm on Wednesday.
He said the Birnin-Gwari-Funtua road had been deserted as a result of the activities of bandits while the entire Eastern part of Birnin-Gwari bordering Zamfara and Katsina states was taken over by armed gangs who attacked villagers at will.      
The chairman said the local government was under siege following the activities of the bandits which prevented the villagers from going to farm and engaging in other activities.
He therefore called on the Federal Government and security agencies to act decisively on the bandits and their collaborators before the entire villages were consumed by the carnage.
“The notorious Unguwar Yako, Kwanan Mahaukaciya and indeed entire Birnin-Gwari-Kaduna highway have been overtaken by bandits terrorising and abducting innocent people especially women and children.
“In the last three weeks, bandits have launched a major onslaught against innocent civilians and motorists across Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State.”  Related News   
Meanwhile, the abducted principal of Government Technical College, Maraban Kajuru in the Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Mr Francis Maji, has been set free by his kidnappers.
Some gunmen in a midnight raid had on Thursday, October 11, invaded the school and kidnapped the principal.
He was kidnapped exactly a week after the abduction of six female pupils, vice principal and a matron at the Engravers College, Kakau Daji in the Chikun Local Government Area of the state.        
But the female pupils and the staff of the college had yet to be released by the gunmen.
The abductors of the principal had demanded N20m as ransom to free him but later reduced the amount to N5m. But the family appealed to the kidnappers to further reduce the ransom saying that their breadwinner was just a civil servant who could not raise such amount of money.
However, on Thursday our correspondent gathered through a teacher in the school who spoke on condition of anonymity that the principal was released at an undisclosed location on Thursday after the payment of the ransom which was not disclosed.
According to him, the principal later boarded a commercial motorcycle  that took him to the school.
“The kidnappers dropped him at a location after they collected the ransom. He had to look for a commercial motorcycle, which brought him back to the school,” the source said.

“Earlier on Wednesday morning around 8:30 a.m., heavily armed bandits opened fire on vehicles around Polwaya and abducted a bread vendor, about ten kilometres from Birnin-Gwari. Similarly, the armed bandits struck again on Wednesday near Gayam village, wounded three vigilante group members and abducted people from vehicles.
“The notorious Unguwar Yako, Kwanan Mahaukaciya and indeed entire Birnin-Gwari-Kaduna highway have been overtaken by bandits terrorising and abducting innocent people especially women and children.
“In the last three weeks, armed bandits have launched a major onslaught against innocent civilians and motorists across the length and breadth of Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
“On a daily basis, the armed bandits carry out their nefarious act along Birnin-Gwari-Kaduna highway in broad daylight without any challenge from the security personnel that are stationed in Birnin-Gwari. The strategic Birnin-Gwari-Funtua road has been deserted, while the entire eastern part of Birnin-Gwari neighbouring Zamfara and Katsina States is now surrounded by armed bandits.
“It is apparent to state categorically, that, Birnin-Gwari is once again under siege by bandits and security personnel and state officials are paying lip service to our plight of general insecurity of lives and property.        
“While we appreciate previous efforts by the security personnel against armed banditry in Birnin-Gwari, we hope the government of Malam Nasiru El- Rufa’i, will not treat our people as prodigal sons.

Enough is enough.”"

There is tension in Ode Omi, a boundary community between Lagos and Ogun states, after some gunmen invaded the area and abducted the son of the Chief Imam, Abdul-azeez Sanni.
Two brothers, Jelili and Bamidele Adams, were also reportedly whisked away by the assailants, who stole a speedboat belonging to the marine police.

He noted that the gunmen struck around 2am on Sunday.
Owoseni stated, “There is a creek opposite our community. That was where the kidnappers came from. They came in their numbers and went straight to the house of the chief imam. They abducted his son, Abdul-azeez, who just returned from Saudi Arabia.
“They then went to another building and kidnapped two brothers, Jelili and Bamidele Adams. Jelili, a tailor, was sewing clothes for his customers for the Eid-el-Kabir when the hoodlums entered the house.

“While they were going, the hoodlums opened fire on some people, who tried to stop them. Three people were seriously injured.”

A community leader, Ademola Azeez, said the kidnappers had earlier been dislodged from the area by security agencies.

According to Azeez, although the community is in Ogun State, the creek from where the gunmen are operating is in Lagos State.
He said there was the need for both state governments to collaborate to fight the bandits.      
“Nobody is safe any longer. When they were leaving on Sunday, they took away another speedboat. They now have enough equipment to move around and cause havoc,” he added.
Our correspondent was told that an Ijaw man found loitering in the community around the time of the attack was handed over to military officers for questioning.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the kidnappers later contacted the families of the victims and demanded N30m for their release.
A resident, Olalekan Osoba, said the community could not raise the money and appealed to the government for help.
He said, “We have been asking for a gunboat. When the Lagos State Government acquired a gunboat for a neighbouring community, which used to be the target  of these people, the hoodlums stopped terrorising it.
“We are the ones they are now facing, because there is no security here. We have written several letters for help all to no avail. We need help.”
While our correspondent was speaking with the residents, gunshots were heard and people ran for their dear lives.

It was later learnt that some security operatives had mobilised to engage the hoodlums.

“They were abducted and taken into the creek. But very soon, we will rescue them,” he said.

Eight people travelling in a bus from Ado Ekiti in Ekiti State to Akure, the Ondo State capital, were allegedly abducted on Tuesday at Ita Ogbolu.
The identities of the victims had not been ascertained as of the time of filing this report as they were said to have been whisked away to an unknown destination in the forest.
“The matter was reported at the Ita Ogbolu Police Division, but nobody knows their whereabouts till now,” a source stated. 
However, the Ondo State Police Command said on Wednesday that only one person was abducted.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Femi Joseph, who identified the victim as Felix Akinde, said the incident happened while the victim was travelling to Akure from Ado Ekiti.
The PPRO said in a statement that the abduction took place few metres away from the National Youth Service Corps farm in Ita Ogbolu, but noted that no serving corps member was involved in the incident.      
He said, “A Toyota Previa space bus was driven by one Felix Akinde from Ikere Ekiti en route Akure yesterday (Tuesday) with only the driver inside. Around 4am on a spot close to the NYSC farm at Ita Ogbolu, the vehicle was blocked by suspected hoodlums, while the driver, who was the only occupant, was whisked away.

24th May 2019,"Man abducts 13-year-old girl, murders her parents","A 21-year-old man has been accused of killing the parents of a 13-year-old girl he abducted.
If convicted, Jake Patterson, a resident of Wisconsin in the United States, risks life sentence.
According to Online reports, he is being tried for charges bordering on kidnapping and intentional homicide.
Patterson had pleaded guilty to kidnapping 13-year-old Jayme Closs after murdering her parents in Barron County, Wisconsin. 
The accused confessed that he committed the crimes on October 15, 2018; and that he randomly chose the victim after seeing her get on a school bus.
He didn’t state any motive for his crimes.
Prosecutors said he shot the girl’s parents at close range, and subsequently held her for 88 days.      
Patterson pleaded guilty to two counts of intentional homicide and one count of kidnapping.
Prosecutors say he faces a maximum of life imprisonment for each of the two homicide counts, along with up to 40 years in prison for the count of kidnapping.
Patterson had no previous criminal record in Wisconsin.
“The crime traumatized the close-knit community and the sentencing is a milestone in its recovery,” said Barron County School District superintendent, Diane Tremblay.  Related News   Jealous Adamawa man beats ex-wife to death  Gunmen kill policeman, kidnap caretaker chairman in Taraba   How my nephew killed his father, hidden by mother – Uncle   
“It’s huge,” said Tremblay, who worked with investigators during the search and comforted Closs’ classmates.
Patterson, who was kicked out of the U.S. Marines after five weeks, carefully planned the crime. He visited the Closs home twice before pulling into the driveway in the early hours of October 15.
Closs alerted her parents to the intruder and she and her mother hid in a bathroom. Her father, James, went to investigate.        
Dressed in black with a face mask, Patterson shot the father through the front door with a shotgun, according to the criminal complaint.
He broke down the bathroom door, bound the girl with duct tape, then shot her mother. He put Closs in the trunk of his car and drove to his cabin in Gordon, about 60 miles (97 km) north of Barron, according to Police.
Patterson, described by people who knew him as quiet and a good student, kept Closs locked in his room and barricaded her under his bed when he had guests, according to court documents.
On January 10, when Patterson left the cabin, the girl escaped. A dog walker found her, neighbours called 911 and Police arrested Patterson shortly after.
Wisconsin lawmakers honored Closs as a “hometown hero” on May 15.
“Jayme, your strength, your resolve and your bravery is beyond incredible,” said her state representative, Romaine Quinn.
“You are truly an inspiration and a bright light in a time of sadness.”"
22nd May 2019,"Bandits kill one, abduct five in Nasarawa","Umar Muhammed, Lafia
Five persons were reportedly kidnapped by bandits in the Toto Local Government Aarea of Nasarawa State on Saturday in separate incidents.
The victims were identified as Basaru Rukaiya, Aishat Zakari, Chinedu Ide, Reuben Ibrahim and Vivian Ibrahim, all of Yelwa village in the Toto LGA.
However, the Nasarawa State Commissioner of Police, Bola Longe, who confirmed the incident to Northern City News on the telephone on Tuesday, said the police were only aware of the abduction of two persons. 
Longe said, “I have information about only two cases of kidnap and the police are investigating the matter. When I assumed duty (as CP), I personally cleared the area of criminals and there was peace until when these criminals came back to disturb the peace of the state.
“I am appealing to citizens of the state to always inform the police using our community policing initiative by reporting all suspicious activities in their towns and villages to enable us fight crime.
“I have directed my officers and men to pursue the criminals to their hideout in order to return peace to the state.”      
According to the police boss, the success recorded by the command in fighting crime within the metropolis has forced the criminals to shift their operational base to the remote areas.
“We are trailing them to the remote areas; if we get them, we will deal with them according to the provisions of the law,” Longe added.
Northern City News gathered that in one of the incidents, the yet-to-be identified bandits killed one Mohammad Shuaibu and kidnapped his wife.  Related News   Troops eliminate three bandits, recover AK-47s, motorcycles, others  172 killed in Benue, Kaduna in one month  Bandits kidnap Zamfara district head   
The bandits were said to have contacted the family of the deceased to demand N20m as ransom for the release of the widow. The ransom was later reduced to N2m.
A resident of the area, Mallam Abdullahi Ahmed, informed our correspondent that the deceased was gruesomely murdered by the bandits.
Meanwhile, no fewer than 14 suspected kidnappers, who are said to have been terrorising residents of Maraba-Udege in Nasarawa State, have been arrested by the police.
The state Commissioner of Police, Bola Longe, paraded the suspects shortly after a press briefing in Lafia on Tuesday.        
He also launched the state chapter of the Operation Puff Adder with a charge to officers and men involved in the operation to root out kidnappers, armed robbers and other criminals from the state.
Longe said the launching of the initiative was in compliance with the spirit and letter of the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu’s directive in that regard.
He stated, “It will be recalled that on April 5, 2019, the IGP, Mohammed Adamu, launched Operation Puff Adder, a special security initiative to confront and root out kidnappings and armed robbery in the country.
“The event took place at the Katari Bishin District along the Abuja-Kaduna Expressway. At the event, the IGP said that the Operation Puff Adder was aimed at dominating and reclaiming the public space from heinous criminal elements that were bent on threatening the nation’s internal security order.”

Two of the company’s employees were also said to have been abducted by the gunmen, who came out of the bush to stop the vehicle travelling from Yenagoa in Bayelsa State to Port Harcourt, Rivers State.
Sky policemen are special security men, who work for corporate organisations in the country. 
It was gathered that the Sky police was driving the escort vehicle when the bandits struck, shooting him first before abducting the two other persons.

A source from the oil firm confirmed the incident but added that efforts were being made by family members to ensure that those abducted regained their freedom.      
“Two of our colleagues were kidnapped on Thursday. They were coming back from Yenagoa when the gunmen came out from the bush. The driver of the escort vehicle, who is a Sky police officer, was killed.

The gunmen had shot and injured one of the workers, who later escaped after pretending to have died during the attack.
Those in the custody of the bandits are Julius Alunomoh, Damian Egwu, Olisa Ojukwu and Chidiebere Wendy, a lady.

Three policemen attached to the National Assembly have been abducted by gunmen in the Gwalluyi community, a few kilometres from their homes at Shere, a rural area close to Maitama, Abuja.
One of the cops, however, escaped from his captors shortly after their abduction, which occurred on Monday evening.
SUNDAY PUNCH gathered on Saturday that the kidnappers were demanding N10m ransom for the release of their victims. 
The policemen were said to be returning from the funeral of a member of their church when they were intercepted by the gunmen at a bad portion of the road leading to Shere community.
The assailants reportedly fired gunshots which narrowly missed the driver and the front passenger of the Toyota car in which they were travelling.
Our correspondent, who visited Shere, saw bullet holes on the front windscreen of the car and other parts of the vehicle.      
Checks indicated that the two policemen had not been released following the inability of their relations to raise the ransom.
Policemen at the Shere police post were reluctant to speak on the issue, saying only their superiors could give an update on the investigation into the incident.

Bandits terrorising Madagali, Adamawa State, on Saturday, killed one person, who attempted to stop the abduction of a herdsman.
During the incident, which occurred in Duhu, one of the six districts in the Madagali Local Government Area of the state, the gunmen allegedly escaped with the herder and his over 100 sheep.
Confirming the incident to Northern City News on Sunday, the District Head of Duhu, Mohammed Sanusi, said the gunmen stormed the community around 12am on Saturday and abducted the victim, whose name could not be immediately ascertained. 
“One person was abducted, another was shot in the leg and over 100 sheep were taken away by the unknown gunmen on Saturday around midnight. The person, who was shot in the leg, later died around 11am on Sunday,” Sanusi said.
He, however, denied that the gunmen were Boko Haram members, insisting that they were bandits, who had been terrorising residents of the area by kidnapping some of them for ransom and ritual killings.  Related News   Again, bandits invade Benue community, kill eight villagers  Bandits attack Kaduna communities, security operatives feared killed  Bandits attack Plateau community, kill village head, others   
The community leader explained that the man, who sustained gunshot wounds, was attacked while trying to play the good Samaritan by attempting to stop the bandits from carrying out their nefarious activities.      
The district head further explained that the bandits had only a few days prior to Saturday’s incident attacked and killed the head of a vigilante outfit, the Pulaaku Civilian Brigade, which was established to stop their criminal activities.
Sanusi paid glowing tributes to Lt. Hulan Kwano of the Nigerian Army, who is involved in the counterinsurgency operations in Madagali, for displaying rare courage in resisting the hoodlums, who attacked Kuda village.
Kwano, whose name translates to ‘Helmet/Cap of steel’, was said to have led the attack, which led to the killing of 56 Boko Haram fighters and the arrest of seven others.

15th February 2019,"Gunmen abduct  Delta APC women leader, demand N30m ransom","Simon Utebor,  Warri
Unidentified gunmen, have abducted an All Progressives Congress women leader in Delta State, identified simply as Margaret.
Margaret is said to be a staunch supporter of the member representing Delta Central Senatorial District in the Senate, Mr Ovie Omo-Agege.
It was learnt that Margaret, a politician and trader from Efurun in the Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State, was abducted on her way back from a campaign rally at Orogun, in the Ughelli North Local Government Area of the state. 
PUNCH Metro gathered that the 50-year-old woman, who contested the councillorship of her local government recently, was in a vehicle belonging to the unnamed director-general of Omo-Agege’s campaign team with three other party faithful.
While the other three occupants of the vehicle escaped from the abductors, Margaret was said to have been unlucky and was whisked away to an unknown destination.
The abductors of the APC member were said to have called a friend of the victim and demanded a ransom of N30m before she could be freed.      
Explaining the plight of the victim, her friend and an APC faithful, who gave his name only as Commander, told our correspondent that Margaret’s captors had called him many times regarding the ransom payment.
Commander, an ex-naval officer, who said the abductors demanded N30m ransom, said he initially did not know that the women leader had been abducted until he called her telephone on Tuesday.
He stated, “When I called her number, a man picked the call and I asked him to give the phone to the owner.
“But the man identified himself as a kidnapper. He told me that he would give me two minutes to speak with the captive for me to know that she had been abducted. I was taken aback when I heard him say that. Anyway, I still called the line to speak with Margaret. She told me that it was true that she had been kidnapped.
“After the two minutes, they collected the phone from her and started negotiating with me. They told me to go and bring N30m to secure her release or they would kill her the next day, being Wednesday. I started begging them not to kill her and that they should allow me to contact her people to let them know of the development.”  Related News   Gunmen kill policeman, kidnap caretaker chairman in Taraba   Lagos couple kidnaps selves, demands N5m ransom from relatives  Woman abducts two siblings in Lagos community   
Commander said the abductors still called him to find out how far he had gone to raise the ransom.
He noted that when the abductors called him again on Thursday, he begged them to spare her and that he was making frantic efforts to reach Margaret’s family and the party hierarchy in the state to handle the matter.

Commander added, “I went to her house on Ogbon Street in Effurun, Uvwie Local Government Area, but did not find anybody in the place. I also reached out to our party ward chairman, Desire Odjebibo, but he told me that Senator Ovie Omo-Agege was aware of the abduction.
“I went further to reach out to the senator himself; he told me that he was aware of the incident and was working to ensure that the woman is released.”
He appealed to the abductors to spare Margaret, describing her as a simple and easy-going woman incapable of hurting anybody.
Efforts to get the Delta State Police Command to react to the development were futile as several calls made to its spokesman, Andrew Aniamaka’s telephone were neither answered nor was a message sent to him responded to as of the time of filing this report.

22nd May 2018,"Septuagenarian, two others abduct receptionist in Lagos","Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe
Luck ran out on three suspected kidnappers on Monday when they were arrested by the police for allegedly abducting a hotel receptionist, Abidemi Omoniyi, 22, in the Egbatedo area of Lagos.
The suspects – Onwuka Makus, 71; Emeka Omenuko, 35; and Blessing Nwaeze, 29 – were said to have come from Ibadan, Oyo State, to perpetrate the crime in Lagos.
The victim, Omoniyi, said she was hurrying to work around 7am when the suspects, who were in a cab, pulled over beside her. 
She said she boarded the car without suspecting them.
She said, “The driver asked where I was going to. I told him Pen- Cinema, Agege, and he charged me N100 for the fare. A woman sat beside the driver when I entered. After about three minutes, two other men entered and they started speaking in Igbo language.
“The driver asked the woman if she closed the boot of the vehicle very well; he got down to check. He returned and started accusing the woman that she had a lot of dollars in the car and she didn’t tell him.      
“The driver asked her how she got the money and she said that she worked as a sexual worker at a Lagos hotel, but the driver said the money would be shared by everybody in the car. She said there was no problem.
“Upon hearing that, I told them that I wanted to get down, but they said I was not going anywhere and I would follow them to Ibadan. Immediately, the woman that sat in the front seat came to the back to hold me and I started screaming.
“The old man among them held my breast and said when we get to Ibadan they would cut off my two breasts. The driver took out a SIM card and one small phone and called a man informing him that they were on their way.”

She said one of the suspects brought out a red rope to tie her hands, adding that she was threatened with death.

“But the lady among them said he should not mind me and that I was her sister. The man asked me if I knew them and I explained everything to him.        
“While we were there, people started gathering and they took us to the Elere Police Station, where they were arrested,” she added.
Meanwhile, a 200-level computer science student of Caleb University, Bamidele Moshood, was also arrested by the Lagos State Police Command for allegedly attempting to snatch a Uber car.
The 17-year-old suspect allegedly committed the crime at Owode-Onirin.
Moshood said he bought a toy gun at a supermarket at Surulere with the intent of using it to scare unsuspecting victims and dispose them of their car and use the proceeds of the sale to pay his school fees.
“I ordered Uber in front of Shoprite in Surulere, he billed me 4,500 from Shoprite down to Agric in Ikorodu.
“When we got to Owode- Onirin, I told him to stop that I want to urinate, he stopped but I told him to move that I’m not peeing again, when he moved, I just held him and ordered him to stop the car, he became scared and lost control; so the car somersaulted thrice.
“When the car somersaulted, I thought the car might explode so I came down immediately and some touts held us and handed us over to the police.      
“I committed the act because I wanted to pay my school fees (N220,000) for this semester. My father refused to pay because he found out that I was smoking hemp,” Moshood said..

13th April 2018,1000 children abducted in N’East since 2013 - UNICEF,"Adelani Adepegba, Abuja
The United Nation Children Fund has disclosed that more than 1,000 children have been abducted by Boko Haram in North-East since 2013, including 276 Chibok schoolgirls taken from their school on April 14, 2014.
The UN agency noted that four years on, more than 100 of the Chibok girls were yet to be returned to their families. It restated its calls for the release of all hostages in Boko Haram custody.
The UNICEF in a statement on Thursday by its representative in Nigeria, Mohammed Fall, disclosed that 2,295 teachers have been killed and more than 1,400 schools destroyed in nine years by the insurgents, noting that most of the schools have not been re-opened. 
“The four-year anniversary of the Chibok abduction reminds us that children in northeastern Nigeria continue to come under attack at a shocking scale, they are consistently targeted and exposed to brutal violence in their homes, schools and public places,” it said.
According to UNICEF, the recent abduction of Dapchi schoolgirls in which five girls lost their lives, is just the latest indication that there are few safe spaces left for children in the Northeast, stressing that not even schools are spared from violence.
“These repeated attacks against children in schools are unconscionable. Children have the right to education and protection, and the classroom must be a place where they are safe from harm,”  Fall noted.        Related News   Africa intensifies energy transition efforts amid climate change concerns  Child marriages falling slowly, practice won’t end for 300 years — UNICEF  UN chief, envoys in key talks on Afghanistan crisis   
UNICEF said the Federal Government had made a commitment to make schools safer and more resilient to attack, “and UNICEF stands with them to implement the Safe Schools Declaration, by which Nigeria commits to protecting schools and universities from violence and military use during armed conflict.”
In a similar vein, ActionAid Nigeria, has expressed solidarity with the families, friends and the Chibok community over the remaining Chibok schoolgirls in Boko Haram captivity.
The Country Director of AAN, Ene Obi said in a statement, “While we commend the efforts of the Federal Government and the military for securing the release of some of these kidnapped girls, today we remember the 113 girls that are yet to be rescued and we join our voice with their families, friends in Nigeria and the international community to call on the Nigerian government to intensify effort to bring back the girls.’’
She added that the abduction of the Dapchi girls’ although now released, had further heightened the vulnerability of the Nigerian girl-child, both in conflict and non-conflict zones.
Obi challenged government at all levels to prioritise safe cities, provision of security and safe spaces in schools in order to encourage girls’ enrolment and retention as well as protect them from all forms of violence.
“The FG and the military should  adopt intelligence, power and negotiation as deployed for the release of the Dapchi girls, to bring back the remaining 113 missing Chibok girls and the remaining Dapchi girl, Leah Shuaibu,” the AAN chief admonished."
13th April 2018,"Boko Haram abducts over 1,000 children in North-East — UNICEF","As Nigeria prepares to mark the fourth anniversary of the Chibok kidnapping, UNICEF reported on Friday that over 1,000 children have been abducted by jihadists since 2013.
“Since 2013, more than 1,000 children have been abducted by Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria, including 276 girls taken from their secondary school in the town of Chibok in 2014,” said UNICEF in a statement.
“These repeated attacks against children in schools are unconscionable,” Mohamed Malick Fall, a UNICEF representative in Nigeria.
Boko Haram’s fight to establish a hardline Islamic state in northeast Nigeria has claimed at least 20,000 lives and displaced more than two million people. 
Schools, particularly those with a secular curriculum, have been targeted by Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates from Hausa — the language spoken widely across northern Nigeria — as “Western education is forbidden”.
At least 2,295 teachers have been killed and more than 1,400 schools destroyed by the Islamist extremists since the conflict started in 2009, according to UNICEF.
While a 2015 offensive launched by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari successfully reclaimed swathes of territory back from the jihadists in Nigeria, the group still stages deadly attacks on both military targets and civilians.      
In February, the Islamists shocked Nigerians by driving unopposed into the northeastern town of Dapchi and kidnapping over 100 schoolgirls.
The response from the authorities — denials then contradictions — was eerily similar to the confusion when the Chibok girls were kidnapped.  Related News   Soldiers kill 54 terrorists, nab 122 suspects  Revisiting the faulty ‘repentant terrorists’ narrative  Boko Haram bomb maker steps on self-made IED, dies   
Most of the girls have since been returned, but the brazen abduction revived painful memories of the Chibok kidnapping in 2014.
Of the 276 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram from the northeastern town of Chibok on April 14, 2014, over 100 are still missing.
Abubakar Shekau, the mercurial Boko Haram leader responsible for using girls as suicide bombers, has claimed in videos that the girls have converted to Islam and have been “married off”.
For those following Boko Haram, the Dapchi kidnapping wasn’t entirely a surprise.
Over the past year, the jihadists have ramped up attacks, killing soldiers, kidnapping government workers and terrorising the northeastern city of Maiduguri with relentless suicide bombings.        
Under pressure to live up to his election promise of beating Boko Haram, this month Buhari reiterated his support for the release of $1 billion in emergency funds to fight the Islamists.
Buhari’s government has recovered scores of the girls. But the negotiations with the jihadists — which reportedly involved ransom payments and the release of high-ranking commanders — rankled critics who questioned the wisdom of funding and rejuvenating the ranks of the extremists.

Gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen have reportedly killed a pastor of the Church of God Mission, one Pius Eromosele, in the Ovia North-East Local Government Area of Edo State.
Eromosele was said to have been abducted by the armed men while working on his farm at Odighi on March 29.
It was learnt that the pastor was later killed by the assailants, who also inflicted a deep cut on his head after accusing him of killing their cows.

Richard also stated that he reported the incident to the police, whom he claimed referred him to the anti-kidnapping unit but allegedly did not do anything to save his late father.
He also said two of his father’s employees; Kingsley and Akpan, narrated how he was killed, after they managed to escape.
He added, “I went to the police and they told me that I should call them whenever the herdsmen called for ransom payment. I did that but there was no response from the police.
“The two workers that escaped told us that the herdsmen told my father that he was one of those killing their cows. It was on Tuesday (April 3), after the police failed to find my father that I begged hunters and vigilantes to help me.        
“It was during the search that we found my father. His skull was cut out with a cutlass while his hands were also cut. We want security agencies to protect farmers in Odighi.’’

12th March 2018,"Man abducts pupil, 3, after tricking  brother with snack","Afeez Hanafi
The parents of Chibugo Onwekwe, a three-year-old pupil at Gospel Nursery and Primary International School, Ahoda, Rivers State, are worried about her safety after she was abducted.
The nursery 1 pupil was reportedly abducted around 8am on February 28, 2017, shortly after she and her elder brother were dropped off by their mother a few metres from the school gate.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the abductor, who was said to be on a motorcycle, had approached the siblings while they were heading towards the school gate. 
He reportedly gave the victim’s brother, eight-year-old Chibuke, N50 and asked him to buy a snack at a nearby shop, while Chibugo stayed behind.
He had whisked the girl away before Chibuke returned to the spot with the snack.
Our correspondent gathered that the primary 3 pupil went to his class, thinking that his sister had also gone to her class.      
Chibugo’s class teacher was said to have noticed that she was absent around 11am and went to Chibuke’s class to ask after her.
The victim’s father, Chibueze Onwekwe, told our correspondent on the telephone on Saturday that in the course of their search, a woman said she saw Chibugo being taken away on a motorcycle.
He said, “On that day, her mother had dropped her and Chibuke off at a junction a few metres away from the school gate and headed for her place of work. That is how she had been doing.
“Chibuke said a man sent her to buy a snack, but when he returned, he didn’t see the man and his sister. It was around 11am that Chibugo’s teacher discovered that she was not in the class. When the teacher met with Chibuke in his class, he narrated what happened.
“A parent said while she was taking her child to the school that morning, she saw Chibugo on a motorcycle being taken away. She said she (Chibugo) waved at her child and that she thought the man was her relation.”
Chibueze said he reported the incident at the Ahoda Police Division, adding that a man, who claimed to know where Chibugo was being held, contacted him on the telephone and demanded N300,000.  Related News   Delta police kill suspected kidnapper, arrest three others  Police arrest kidnapper, recover 40 animals from hideout  Adamawa police kill kidnapper at ransom delivery point, rescue victims   
“The man sent me a message on the day she was kidnapped. He said he had vital information about my daughter and that I should pay him N300,000. I didn’t reply to his message that day.        
“When I contacted him the next day, he suspected that I had informed the police. After I begged and assured him that I would not involve the police, he said I should pay N50,000 to track those who kidnapped my daughter.
“Since I sent the money into the bank account he provided, he has stopped taking my calls,” he added.
The victim’s mother, Evelyn, a teacher at a neighbouring school, said she was at work when her children’s teacher informed her about the incident.
She said, “The junction where I dropped them is a stone’s throw from the school and a lot of pupils usually pass through the place. I was surprised when I got a call that Chibugo was not in school.
“I rushed to the school and discovered that it was true. She is in nursery 1 and will be four years old in two months.”
The victim’s brother, Chibuke, said the abductor was dark in complexion and wore a black and white uniform.
“The man was on a motorcycle. He gave me N50 to buy a snack. By the time I came back, I didn’t see the man and my sister again,” he added.      
Calls made to the school’s phone number, which the parents gave to our correspondent, did not go through.
The Rivers State Police Public Relations Officer, Nnamdi Omoni, promised to get back to our correspondent with comment on the incident, but had yet to do so as of press time.

Some gunmen, suspected to be kidnappers, have abducted Mr. Robert Desmond, the Chief Executive Officer, New Face, a pro-All Progressives Congress campaign group, in the Brass Local Government Area of Bayelsa State.
Desmond was reportedly abducted on Saturday after a social event in Nembe, in the Nembe LGA.
The victim was said to be a staunch supporter of a former Governor of the state, Chief Timipre Sylva, and an APC member at the state House of Assembly, Israel Sunny-Igoli. 
The abduction has, however, thrown the Nembe and Brass areas of the state into chaos with residents and party faithfuls speculating on the motive behind the abduction.
While some members of the New Face group claimed that the abduction was politically-motivated and targeted at some APC members ahead of the 2019 national and state assembly elections in the area, others claimed that the abduction was carried out by gunmen who wanted to make money from the family.
Some APC supporters, however, expressed fear that the pro-APC campaigner might have been killed by his abductors.      
But the Police Public Relations Officer, Bayelsa State Command, Asinim Butswat, dismissed the claims.

Members of a suspected cult group, Iceland, have reportedly kidnapped the youth leader of Udianga Enem community in the Etim Ekpo Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Itoro Inuaowo.
A security guard, who did not want his name in print, told PUNCH Metro on Tuesday that the cult members arrived in Inuaowo’s compound on three motorcycles around 6am and whisked him away at gunpoint.
It was learnt that the Iceland members, popularly called The Red, were out to avenge the death of their leader, Akaniyene Jumbo (Iso Akpafid), who was ambushed and killed by the military in January. 
Although the motive of the abduction had yet to be ascertained, the guard told our correspondent that the youth leader was raising funds for security in the community when he was abducted.
Meanwhile, angry youths in the area have started a mass protest against the killing of members of the community by the hoodlums.
They accused the LGA Chairman, Mr. Udeme Eduo, of failing in his responsibility to protect lives and property of those who voted for him.      
One Effiok Essien, who is at the internally displaced persons camp at Iwukem, said, “We are living in exile in Iwukem because there are standby police station and mobile police base here. The LG Chairman, Mr. Udeme Eduo, has not done anything to protect our lives and property.”  Related News   Three arrested for killing Philippine governor  Police nab suspected criminal tricycle operator  FG lists crimes prevalent in N’West, S’South, others

“This is farming season; we cannot plant anything because our farms are not safe. All the things we planted last season, including corn, yam, cassava, palm oil and other farm produce, have been taken over by these gunmen.”
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko Ogbeche, blamed the locals for not volunteering information and reporting crimes in their communities to law enforcement agents.
He said he would get in touch with the Divisional Police Officers with a view to getting security updates in the troubled areas.

6th February 2018,Woman allegedly abducts her landlady's children,"Peter Dada, Akure
A female tenant whose identity has yet to be ascertained has reportedly kidnapped two of her landlady’s children seven days after packing into the house.
The abode is located in Okedogbon Area of Owo, headquarters of Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State.
The two kids, identified as Ayomide Olamilekan (six months old) and Blessing Olamilekan (two and a half years old) were abducted and taken to an unknown destination by the tenant who was said to be friendly with the children. 
A source said the female tenant and a man suspected to be her husband rented a room from the mother of the abducted children, Mrs. Abimbola Olamilekan, and paid six-month rent.
The source said the landlady did not have any information about the tenant up till the time she absconded with her kids, n0r did she know any of her (tenant’s) relatives in the town.
However, it was gathered that the fleeing tenant and her husband hail from the South-South region of the country.      
A source narrated that the victims’ mother was washing clothes at the back of the building when the tenant offered to assist her in taking care of the children.
“She took the kids away and never returned,” the source said.
“Just exactly seven days she (tenant) and her husband moved into the house, the mother of the abducted kids was washing clothes at the back of the house.

“As she carried the baby on her back, the second child also became troublesome and she took her along, promising their mother that she wanted to go and buy biscuit for them at a nearby provision shop.
“The mother released the children to her and it was after several hours when the tenant did not return with her babies that she raised the alarm.”
Another source said after some days when the tenant and the husband did not return to the house, the search party in the area broke into the suspected kidnappers’ room to see if they could obtain something with which to track them; but only a bedsheet was found spread on the floor.        
When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer of the Ondo State Police Command, Mr. Femi Joseph, confirmed the incident.
He said the whereabouts of the kids and their abductors was unknown at the time of filing this report.
He said, “The mother of the victims has been invited, but she told us that she had no personal details of the tenant before giving them the apartment. This is wrong and careless.
“We are still on it, and we have commenced investigation into the incident.
“We will try our best to get the children freed and the kidnappers arrested.”"

19th January 2018,Gunmen abduct five oil workers in Niger Delta,"Five oil workers have been kidnapped in Nigeria’s restive southern Niger Delta region, an area regularly hit by militant attacks and abductions, police told AFP on Friday.
Suspected militants seized the workers on Wednesday near the Ajoki community, which borders Edo and Delta States, said Delta State police spokesperson, Andrew Aniamaka.
“The police in partnership with the military are working to ensure that the victims are rescued unhurt with the perpetrators arrested and brought to book,” Aniamaka said.
The workers are employees of Sahara Energy Oil Company, a Nigerian energy firm. 
“The oil workers were in a boat en route to an offshore location when the gunmen arrived,” said local resident Ajugu Fidelis, who witnessed the abductions.
“(They) stormed the waterside and ordered the workers into their boat amidst gunshots and sped off to an unknown location.”  Related News   Two abducted Delta Catholic priests regain freedom  Security operatives arrest three kidnappers, rescue victim  Delta widow tags son-in-law kidnapper, man blames wife   
The incident happened a few hours after the Niger Delta Avengers, a rebel group known to attack oil pipelines, issued a statement warning the government it was ending a 2017 ceasefire agreement.      
The NDA’s targeting of oil and gas infrastructure in 2016 led to a slump in output that helped tip Nigeria into recession.
Kidnapping has long been a problem in Nigeria’s southern states where high-profile individuals, including the families of prominent politicians, are regularly seized.
But as the economy stalled in recent years, the abductions have begun to happen further north as well.
On Tuesday, two Americans and two Canadians were kidnapped by unidentified armed men in an ambush in northern Kaduna state.

15th January 2018,"Gunmen abduct former Bayelsa commissioner, soldier","Simon Utebor,  Yenagoa
Gunmen, suspected to be kidnappers, have abducted a former Commissioner for Transport in Bayelsa State, Mrs. Marie Ebikake, and a military official in the state.
The abductions took place in two separate incidents.
While Ebikake, the first female Chairman of the Brass Local Government Area, was abducted on Sunday at her residence in Igbogene, Yenagoa, the soldier, identified simply as Rotimi, was abducted along the Foropa-Gbarain route of the Southern Ijaw creek. 
The assailants reportedly seized Rotimi on his way to Yenagoa, shot the driver of the boat conveying him in the shoulder and stole the engine of the boat.
Ebikake, an indigene of the Brass LGA and a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, was reportedly abducted at about 1.30am on Sunday.
Ebikake had resigned as Commissioner for Transport during the campaign for the re-election of Governor Seriake Dickson amidst a political dispute between Dickson and the wife of a former president, Patience Jonathan.      
She was reported to have later returned to Dickson’s political camp.
Our correspondent gathered that Ebikake was a key member of the contact and reconciliation committee of the state chapter of the PDP set up by the governor.
It was learnt that three days before her abduction, some armed men had invaded her country house in Twon-Brass, in the Brass LGA, and vandalised the palatial residence.
It was further learnt that although she was not at home during the invasion,  the armed men destroyed her bullet-proof doors and broke eggs on her vehicles and doors.
Speaking on Ebikake’s abduction, a family source said the gunmen were about 15 in number.
The source explained that the hoodlums scaled the fence and entered the house through a window in the apartment.
He wondered why they came for her, saying she did not have any issue with anyone. The source equally ruled out any political motive in the abduction.        
He said, “In that house where she was abducted, there were some children. Her husband was also around. It is a three-bedroomed flat. Her orderly, a policeman, was living in another flat in the house with some other boys. The driver was in another apartment and the security guard was at the gatehouse.  Related News   Kidnapped Imo bizman found dead in Anambra after N10m ransom payment  Bayelsa election tribunal receives 31 petitions  Rampaging gunmen kill three policemen at Anambra checkpoint   
“What they (kidnappers) did was to use big sticks to destroy the barbed wire carrying electricity current on the fence. When they saw that the barbed wire was slack, they scaled the fence, went in and broke the burglar-proof bar in one of the rooms where the children were sleeping.
“From there, they went into her room and seized her. They also opened the fridge and took some drinks; they ate groundnuts and biscuits. Thereafter, the kidnappers collected all their phones and left with her through the same window.
“As they were going with her to the gate, they asked her for the gate keys. She called the security guard, one David. As David did not answer, one of them opened fire on the gatehouse. The door was ridden with bullets. About that time, the gateman had already hid in the attic.
“Afterwards, they used something to open the pedestrian side of the gate and escaped. They left about 40 minutes before some policemen arrived.
“From what the gateman said, about five persons entered into the compound.  Three went into the house, two were just walking around in the compound, and five persons kept guard around the gate. About 15 persons carried out the abduction.”
The Caretaker Chairman, Brass LGA, Victor Isaiah, described the abduction as shocking and condemnable.      
Isaiah said, “I am shocked at this act of wickedness by evil and cold-hearted elements on a peaceful and harmless woman. I am saddened that our mother and leader will be subjected to an harmful experience in the hands of those uncultured criminals.
“I call on the abductors to release her unconditionally, unhurt and in sound health. I also urge security agents to intensify efforts at rescuing her.”
When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Bayelsa State Command, Mr. Asinim Butswat, confirmed the abduction of Ebikake.
Butswat, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, said, “She was abducted at her residence by gunmen at about 1am today (Sunday). Manhunt has been launched to apprehend the perpetrators.”
Efforts to speak with the Coordinator of the Joint Media Campaign Centre, Operation Delta Safe, Major Ibrahim Abdullahi,  on the abduction of the soldier, were not successful as of press time.

11th January 2018,"Boko Haram insurgents attack village in Cameroon, kill four, abduct two","Four people were killed and two others kidnapped in separate overnight attacks in the far north of Cameroon, blamed on the Islamist group Boko Haram, sources told AFP on Thursday.
Three of the victims were “slaughtered” in Kolofata, a town which borders Nigeria and that has seen a spate of attacks blamed on the jihadists, said a source close to the security services.
A security officer in the region confirmed the information to AFP, and that two people were also abducted.
In a second overnight attack, Boko Haram fighters are believed to have killed one person and injured another in nearby Ashigashiya, also by the Nigerian border, said the security officer. 
The jihadists also burned some 60 boxes of grain and motorcycles, he added.
The attacks come after Cameroon and three other west African states launched a major offensive against the jihadist group in Borno state, in north east Nigeria this week.
Cameroon soldiers, along with troops from Chad, Nigeria and Niger, are targeting a Boko Haram faction led by Abubakar Shekau in the Sambisa Forest, and another led by Mamman Nur, on and around Lake Chad.

According to the Nigerian military, scores of jihadists have been killed and hundreds of others have been forced to surrender in recent days.
Boko Haram began its bloody insurgency in Nigeria in 2009, seeking to install an extremist Islamic state in the country.
The militants began cross-border attacks in 2014, and have regularly carried out raids in Cameroon, killing, looting and kidnapping villagers.
Since 2014, Cameroon has been fighting a military campaign against the group, including cross-border operations with Nigerian troops.
But the group is estimated to have killed some 2,000 civilians and soldiers, and abducted more than a thousand people, in the last four years.
Across the region, violence committed by Boko Haram has killed at least 20,000 and displaced more than 2.6 million people.

3rd January 2018,Boko Haram abducts 31 loggers in Borno,"The alleged kidnapping took place just days after 30 troops vanished following a raid on a military base in the same region amid a surge in bloody violence.
Sources told AFP the loggers, mostly in their twenties, had left the town of Gamboru on the border with Cameroon Tuesday morning to fetch firewood in a Boko Haram hotspot.
“All 31 have not been seen since yesterday and it is obvious they were seized by Boko Haram,” said Umar Kachalla, a militia in Gamboru fighting Boko Haram alongside the military.
The loggers had left for Wulgo village in nearby Marte district, 15 kilometres away, with their axes and wooden carts to collect wood to sell and raise money to buy food, Kachalla said. 
Two weeks ago, Boko Haram gunmen shot dead 10 loggers from Gamboru in the bush outside Wulgo while collecting firewood, said another militia Shehu Mada.
“We believe Boko Haram abducted them to use them as fighters, given their young age,” Mada said.
“They (Boko Haram) abandon the bodies of their victims when they kill them but the fact that the bodies of the loggers have not been seen is clear indication they were abducted,” said Mada.      
Boko Haram fighters still operate in hard-to-reach rural areas where military operations are minimal.
In August 2014, the group seized Gamboru, a trading hub along with the neighbouring town of Ngala.  Related News   Borno working to resettle repentant terrorists – Govt  FG approves N16bn refund to Borno state govt  Borno seeks FG’s assistance on $5bn facilities destroyed by terrorists   
Nigerian troops retook both towns in September 2015 with the help of Chadian forces following offensives lasting months.
Despite the recapture of the area, Boko Haram fighters continue to launch sporadic attacks, ambushing troops and vehicles, as well as attacking and abducting farmers.
Last week two farmers were shot dead by jihadists while harvesting their crops in Bugda village outside Gamboru, according to resident Nasiru Saidu.
Boko Haram’s eight-year insurgency against the government of Nigeria has spilled into neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon, killing around 20,000 people and displacing more than 2.6 million.
Most of the displaced rely on food handouts from aid agencies while others have turned to felling trees in the arid region for firewood which they sell to buy food.        
The jihadists have increasingly targeted loggers in their armed campaign, accusing them of spying and passing information to the military and the local militia fighting them.
On Christmas Day the jihadists killed 25 loggers at a logging site outside the city of Maiduguri.

A former Minister of Sports and Plateau State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chief Damishi Sango, and four other persons have been abducted by gunmen who have demanded N100m ransom.
The other persons that were kidnapped are one of the PDP elders in Plateau State, Chief Emmanuel Mangni; Sango’s son, his driver, and his police orderly.
Mangni was said to be the coordinator of one of the aspirants for the position of PDP national chairman, Uche Secondus. 
The PDP national convention, during which the election for the party’s national executive will take place, is scheduled for Saturday.
Although the details of the incident were still sketchy, sources said the victims were abducted on Wednesday along Jere Road, in Kaduna State while on their way to Abuja to attend the convention.
The Publicity Secretary of the PDP in Plateau State, John Akans, confirmed the incident in an interview with PUNCH Metro in Jos on Thursday.      
He said, “Our Chairman, Chief Damishi Sango, and four other persons, comprising his son, driver, orderly and a chieftain of the PDP in Plateau State, were kidnapped by gunmen on Wednesday.
“The police told his family about the incident because his son’s phone was seen inside the vehicle. That is the information available to us now.
“The information got to us around midnight. He left Jos about 2pm and was heading for Abuja in preparation for the PDP national convention. He was not alone; he was with an elder statesman and one of the PDP elders in Plateau State, Chief Emmanuel Mangni. Incidentally, Mangni is the coordinator of one of the aspirants for the position of PDP national chairman, Uche Secondus.”

“They are still with their abductors.We are waiting to see whether the kidnappers will reduce the ransom tomorrow. I am on my way to Abuja.”
Asked if he suspected whether the incident had any link with the PDP convention or if the abductors were Fulani herdsmen, Akans said it could be the normal case of kidnapping as there was insecurity in the country.        
He said, “The Jere Road has been a flashpoint and Kaduna State is a den of kidnappers. It was the security operatives that told the family that their breadwinner had been kidnapped because the car that was abandoned drew the attention of the security operatives.
“On reaching the car, they found a telephone belonging to his son in the car. When his personal assistant couldn’t get him when he tried to reach him, he called his son’s line and it was picked by one of the policemen.
“They told us that the car was with them and there was no occupant.”
When contacted, the spokesperson for the Plateau State Police Command, Matthias Tyopev, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, said efforts were on to rescue the captives.
“The incident happened in Jere, Kaduna State, and is not under my jurisdiction. But let me confirm that Damishi Sango has been kidnapped because we have received the signal from Kaduna. The man has been kidnapped and efforts are on to secure his freedom,” he said.

2nd December 2017,"Fellow Nigerians abducted, sold us into slavery in Libya –Returnees","•••say countrymen more wicked than Arabs
•Over 400,000 still stranded –AU Commission
Dayo Oketola, Adelani Adepegba, Kunle Falayi, Alexander Okere 
In the midst of the uproar over revelations that Libyan nationals are buying and selling migrants as slaves in Libya, Saturday PUNCH has learnt that Nigerians based in the country also sell their fellow countrymen. 
This emerged as more Nigerians are repatriated by the International Organisation for Migration with the backing of the European Union in an ongoing exercise that has seen 1,295 retrieved from Libya in November alone.
Since the beginning of 2017, IOM-facilitated repatriation has brought back 5,578 Nigerian migrants, who were trapped in and outside prisons across Libya.
On Thursday night, 150 migrants from mostly Edo and Delta states arrived the country aboard a Buraq Airplane at the cargo terminal of the Murtala International Airport, Lagos. It was two days after 239 migrants had also been brought into the country.      
Many of the returnees, who were thankful for being back, confirmed to Saturday PUNCH that they were sold by their fellow countrymen, who were getting rich in Libya.
One of them, 26-year-old Odion Saliu, a hairdresser from Edo State, said she was kidnapped and handed over to a Nigerian, who forced her to call her mother.
According to her, her mother in Benin paid N200, 000 but she was again sold by the same Nigerian for 3,000 dinars (about N794, 000).
Saliu explained that the Nigerians spoke Pidgin English and some Nigerian languages.
She said, “When I was kidnapped with others and held for some weeks, the Arabs asked if I wanted to be taken to a Nigerian and I readily said yes. I was very happy that I was going to someone from my country. But it was a lie.
“The Nigerian they took me to locked me in a cell and told me to call my mother and ask for N60, 000. The man said he would sell me to a connection house if my family did not get the money. I called to inform my mother and the trafficker who facilitated my journey from Nigeria.
“But the trafficker spoke with them on the phone and told them the amount they demanded was too small. They increased it to N200, 000. My mother paid into an account after they provided her with the account number over the phone.        
“The Nigerian said if I wanted to cross the sea, I had to pay him again. But when we got to the seaside, he sold me again.”
Another Edo State indigene, Sunday Anyaegbunam, left Nigeria along with his wife in April.
He said during their nine-day journey through the desert, they were sold twice by Nigerians.
According to him, when their Nigerian “burger” (trafficker) sold them to another set of Libyan traffickers at Agadez, Niger, the traffickers sold him and his wife to a Nigerian who took them to Sabha, Libya, where they were separated in different cells.
“We were made to contact our families on the phone and I had to ensure the payment of N400, 000 for my release and N300, 000 for my wife,” Anyaegbunam said.
Like others, he could only identify the Nigerians trading in their countrymen in Libya through the Nigerian languages they spoke and their accent.
He said, “The Nigerians selling people in Libya are more wicked than many of the Arabs. I have never seen people so heartless as the Nigerians who bought and sold me.      
“There are many of them in Agadez and Sabha, who are making so much money from selling their own people. But there are other West Africans doing the business too.
“When you approach them and say, ‘Please, my brother, help me.’ They would tell you, “No brother in the jungle.”
A 25-year-old woman, Esosa Osas, who was in Libya for six months, said she also met many Nigerians selling their countrymen.
“You dare not talk to them, else they would beat you and lock you up. They sell women for 5,000 dinars and men for N4, 000 dinars. I noticed that the connection houses were also controlled by Nigerian women.”
All these accounts were corroborated by 35-year-old Harrison Okotie who lived in Libya for three years until his repatriation.
“Nigerians and Libyans are doing the business like they are one big happy family,” he said.
Most of the migrants who arrived Nigeria on Thursday were from Edo State.  
Officials of the state’s task force on illegal migration were on hand with luxurious buses to transport their people back home.
A member of the task force, Mr. Okoduwa Solomon, told Saturday PUNCH that his team had made six such journeys to the airport within the last one month to take their indigenes repatriated from Libya back home.
He said, “The first process is to take them through counselling, then we profile them.
“After that, we put them in a home that the state government has provided for the returnees. The Edo State Government is paying each of the returnees from the state a stipend.
They are going to undergo a training in agriculture, poultry, fishery and others to make them useful to themselves and the system.”
Officials of the National Emergency Management Agency coordinate the reception of the returnees at the airport.South West Zonal Coordinator of the agency, Mr. Yakubu Sulaiman, said the returnees would be lodged in a hotel where they would have the chance to clean up before their journey back home.
Meanwhile, President, Women Arise and Centre for Change, Dr. Joe Okei-Odumakin, has called on the Federal Government to use all diplomatic channels to prevail on the Libyan authorities to ensure the dignity of our people.      
She said in a statement on Friday that it was an embarrassment that Nigerians who were treated like royalty in the past were being dehumanised in a foreign land.
“We must build a country where our people have opportunities to prosper and lead useful and productive lives and will only travel on leisure and business and not as illegal migrants desperate to live anywhere other than Nigeria,” she said.
Over 400,000 Nigerians, others still stranded in Libya –AU Commission
Meanwhile, Head, African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, has said that over 400,000 Nigerians and others remain stranded in Libya.  Related News   Our experience in Libya hellish – Returnees  26 children, 125 adult Libyan returnees land in Lagos  126 stranded Nigerians return from Libya   
Hundreds of thousands more — “400,000 to 700, 000,” according to  Mahamat — remain stranded.
European and African leaders have set themselves a tall order to stamp out horrific abuse of African migrants, some of them are Nigerians in Libya, where thousands are suffering in a vast, lawless territory.
On Thursday, a summit of the African Union and the European Union set a goal of immediately repatriating 3,800 migrants languishing in a camp near Tripoli.        
But experts pointed to a daunting array of hurdles, from extracting migrants in perilous situations to giving them incentives to stay put when they return home.
Even so, the summit’s commitment, initiated by outrage over a CNN television report on black Africans being sold as slaves in Libya, is being welcomed.
“It is a step in the right direction,” International Organisation for Migration Europe Director,  Eugenio Ambrosi,  told Agence France Presse by phone from Brussels.
“It is a little bit too much to think it will solve the slavery issue, but it would definitely mitigate (it) to some extent,” Ambrosi said.
He said the summit also showed there was now “international watchdog pressure” that could be brought to bear on the criminal gangs, but it must be “sustained.”
The drive was announced at a meeting on the summit sidelines organised by French President, Emmanuel Macron.
It brought together eight other EU and African countries as well as the AU, EU and United Nations representatives.      
Macron said the UN-backed Libyan government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj had identified and granted access to the worst camps to enable the returns of people who want to go home.
The Macron group also decided to work with a task force, involving the sharing of police and intelligence services, to “dismantle the networks and their financing and detain traffickers,” he said.
They pledged to freeze the assets of identified traffickers. The AU is expected to set up an investigative panel and the UN could take cases before the International Court of Justice.
Libya calls for campaign against human trafficking
The Libyan government has condemned the reported auction of West Africans in its capital Tripoli, noting that the criminal practice was not part of the culture of the Libyan people.
It called for an international campaign against illegal migration and demanded an end to “exploitation, the suffering of the ambitious African man looking for better life in Europe and human trafficking right from the country of source.”
Speaking on the alleged auction of West Africans in his country at a press conference on Friday in Abuja, the Charge d’Affairs and ambassador-designate, Libyan embassy in Nigeria, Dr. Attia Alkhoder, explained that his government had ordered the relevant agency to carry out a comprehensive investigation into the incident.      
He said the government was concerned about illegal migration and human trafficking, adding that Libya needed technical and logistical support to control its southern border, which is the major route for illegal migration across the Mediterranean Sea.
The diplomat criticised the media for attacking and holding his country responsible for the slaves’ auction, noting that human trafficking and the reported slaves’ auction were done by individuals and not the Libyan authorities.
Alkhoder said, “Libya renews its call to put an end to exploitation, the suffering of the ambitious African man looking for better life in Europe and human trafficking.
“Libya calls for an international campaign to put an end to this phenomenon by providing security and border control to end the Libyan crisis, unify its government institutions and end the transition system that contributed a lot in the weakening control of territory.”
The envoy noted that solving illegal migration was a collective responsibility involving countries of origin, transit and destination.
He added that Libya spent a lot of money accommodating immigrants and facilitating their voluntary return to their countries, insisting that curbing illegal migration needed serious coordination of international efforts.
Returnees get N100m, 150 hectares of land for farming      
Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has approved a seed capital of N100m and 150 hectares of land for 150 victims of human trafficking, who recently completed skills acquisition training in the state.
Obaseki announced this on Friday during the graduation of the participants of the programme, which was organised by the Edo Agricultural Development Programme in Benin City, the state capital.
He also directed the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources to immediately liaise with the relevant authorities towards securing the land for the returnees to commence their agricultural businesses.
According to the governor, the beneficiaries would be put under the supervision of the Benin-Owena River Basin Authority and the EADP.
Obaseki stressed the need for coordinated efforts to end modern slavery.
He stated that the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, marked on December 2 annually by the United Nations, should be seen as a day for deep reflection on how to bring the illicit trade to an end.
Obaseki said, “We ordinarily should not be talking about the menace of slavery given the experience we have had. But it is a reality today and we have no choice but to tackle it.      
“However, it is pertinent to point out the fact that modern-day slavery, in its various forms, such as forced labour, debt bondage, and human trafficking, has no place among us. To effectively abolish slave trade as we have it today, it takes a coordinated, deep-reaching, international coalition that will take into cognisance the various forms of modern-day slavery and compel perpetrators to back down.”
He, however, commended the returnees, comprising 51 trained on crop production, 15 on agro-processing, 68 on livestock farming and 52 on fish farming, for participating in the programme.
He also urged them to be ambassadors in the state-wide campaign against human trafficking and illegal migration.
Earlier, the Programme Manager of the EADP, Mr. Peter Aikhuomobhogbe, commended the state government for initiating the training and expressed optimism that the trainees would put the skills acquired to good use.

A pastor, Oluwafemi Komolafe, and a yet-to-be-identified policeman attached to the Ondo State Police Command have been killed by some gunmen at Ore, Benin-Ijebu Ode Expressway, in the Odigbo Local Government Area of Ondo State.
Oluwafemi was a pastor in one of the popular churches in Akure, the state capital.
The pastor was said to be travelling with his son, Timilehin, an undergraduate at a private university, when the gunmen, suspected to be kidnappers, stopped them on the road on Friday. 
It was gathered that the pastor was taking Timilehin back to school when they were attacked.
After shooting the pastor dead, the gunmen were said to have abducted the son.
PUNCH Metro learnt that while the operation was ongoing, a bus heading for Lagos from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, ran into the scene of the incident.      
While some passengers escaped into the bush, two of them were said to have been captured by the gunmen.
The Ondo State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Gbenga Adeyanju, said on getting the information, the command deployed men in the area to rescue the victims.
He explained that although the police rescued the pastor’s son and the two passengers, one of the policemen was shot dead.
Adeyanju, who did not disclose the name of the slain policeman, identified the two passengers as Henry Popoola and Michael Osifo.
He said, “The man (pastor) was travelling with his son when the kidnappers stopped them on the road. They shot the man dead and took the boy away. On getting information on the activities of the hoodlums, our men stormed the scene and engaged the gunmen in a shootout; but they escaped. We lost one of our men who went for the operation.

“After the incident, our men, with the assistance of the local hunters, combed the area. When we got to the kidnappers’den, we surrounded them. There was a serious exchange of gunfire. Some of them escaped with bullet injuries, while we were able to rescue the three victims in the kidnappers’ den. The boy, whose father was killed and two other travellers, who were going to Lagos from Port Harcourt, were rescued safely.”
The CP said the victims were unhurt, noting that the police would continue to hunt the hoodlums until they were arrested.        
He appealed to the people of the state to always inform the police whenever they observed suspicious movements in their environment.
The victims, who looked traumatic, declined to comment on their experience in the kidnappers’ den.
As of the time of filing this report, they were still in the custody of the state police command.
The Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, in a statement, commended the men of the command for rescuing the victims.
He also lauded the local hunters in the communities and the Police Community Relations Committee for collaborating with the police during the operation.
According to the governor, the collaboration provided the intelligence which aided the police to mobilise personnel to the kidnappers’ hideout and bring out the victims alive.
“There is the need for the people of the state to emulate the local hunters by volunteering information on suspicious movements and characters so as to make the state uncomfortable for unscrupulous elements,” Akeredolu added.

8th October 2017,Swiss woman abducted in Darfur,"A Swiss woman, reportedly working for an aid organisation, has been abducted in the conflict-torn Darfur region of Sudan, Switzerland’s foreign ministry said Sunday.
The Swiss foreign ministry told AFP in an email it was “aware of the case of a Swiss woman kidnapped in Sudan (Darfur).”
“Our local representatives are in contact with the local authorities,” it said, adding that the case was being investigated.
The foreign ministry did not provide any details on the identity of the abducted woman or the circumstances surrounding her kidnapping. 
The Sudanese government has not confirmed or officially commented on the incident.
But social media reports indicated she had been working for a Swiss non-governmental organisation providing aid to children, and that she was abducted in the North Darfur capital of El-Fashir.

Just weeks ago, the United Nations peace-keeping force began downsizing its presence in the region and days ago Washington lifted its 20-year-old trade embargo against Khartoum.
Several aid workers in Darfur had raised concerns over their safety following the decision to withdraw some UN forces from the region.
More than 2.5 million people have fled their homes since 2003, when a conflict erupted in Darfur after ethnic minority rebels took up arms against Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir’s Arab-dominated government, accusing it of marginalising the region economically and politically.
Most of the displaced live in camps, after escaping fighting between government forces and rebels that the United Nations says has killed around 300,000 people.

29th August 2017,"Pastor, others allegedly abduct 18-month-old girl at 3am, found with her severed heart","Mudiaga Affe, Calabar
A 20-year-old mother, Faith Inyang, on Tuesday disclosed how a pastor, Tony Obo-Ekpeyong, allegedly broke into her home alongside six others to steal her 18-month old baby girl that was allegedly used for rituals.
Narrating the sordid incident to media men at the headquarters of the Cross River State Command in Calabar on Tuesday, Inyang said her baby was stolen at about 3am on August 24 by masked men whom she said she was able to identify.
She said she was able to identify the pastor because he and the other alleged assailants lived in the same neighbourhood as her. 
The state Police Command paraded the pastor, who oversees the Royal God’s Commandment Ministry; and six others for allegedly killing the little baby and also for allegedly being in possession of what was suspected to be her heart.
Inyang told The PUNCH that the suspects invaded her house, located around the Calabar-South axis of the state capital in the wee hours of the morning and ordered all the occupants to lie down while they forcefully took her baby away.
She said, “When they broke into our house, we pleaded with them not to hurt us. They came in with machetes and they used it on me and my cousin before taking my child away.      
“I recognised one of the men because of his stature; he lived around our area and he normally passed through our house.
“When they left, we came out and started shouting for help and some men in the area came out and trailed them to the church
“Everything became clear in the morning and the Police came in and arrested them. Up till now, I have not seen the body of my daughter, apart from the heart that was found there.”  Related News   Jealous Adamawa man beats ex-wife to death  Gunmen kill policeman, kidnap caretaker chairman in Taraba   How my nephew killed his father, hidden by mother – Uncle   
Parading the suspects, the state Police spokesperson, ASP Irene Ugbo, said the pastor was arrested alongside six others on Thursday, August 24, by men of the command.
Ugbo explained that the suspects were arrested when the parents of the child raised the alarm that their child had been abducted by masked men who broke into their house.
According to the ASP, the Police immediately swung into action, searched the church surroundings and found some ‘incriminating items’ and thereafter arrested the pastor and six others.
“On the 24th of August 2017, we received a distress call that one pastor in a church in Calabar South has killed an 18-month-old baby girl.        
“When we got there, the heart of the child was still breathing. The suspect claimed that it was a fowl’s heart. So, we have sent the heart to the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital for proper analysis.
“We actually heard some rumours that the Police have collected money to release the suspects. We have called the Press here today in order to show to the world that the suspects are still in our custody and investigation is ongoing.
“The Police cannot release murder suspects, kidnappers and others without due process. We are going to charge the suspects to court immediately,” Ugbo said.
The suspect, pastor Obo-Ekpeyong, denied the allegations, saying that he did not kill the child for any ritual purpose.
“I was praying for one of our members who was sick when the Police came and arrested me. The heart they saw was that of a fowl. We don’t operate any spiritual shrine in the church.
“The thick blood that was seen on the altar was that of a goat and fowl that we killed to celebrate with members after our three-day fasting programme in the church,” Obo-Ekpeyong said."

1st December 2018,How nanny abducted two Lagos schoolchildren – Source,"Afeez Hanafi
A source at PrimeRose School in Gbagada Phase II, Lagos State has given insights into the events that led to the abduction of two pupils of the school.
 The kids – Nadia Mutana, six, and Khalifa Mutana, three – were abducted on Monday by their nanny, who picked them up from the school after closing time.
While Nadia is in Primary one, her brother is said to be a Nursery one pupil. 
READ ALSO: Tax evaders will be jailed – Rivers govt
 City Round learnt that the abductor, identified only as Busayo, was employed about eight days before the incident through the kids’ grandmother.
 It was however said that not much was known about her details as efforts to track her had yet to yield positive results. The nanny’s phone number was also reportedly not reachable.      
The victims’ parents declined to speak about the abduction when our correspondent visited them on Friday at their residence on Olusola Olude Close, Gbagada Phase II.
The house is some distance away from the school located on Bunmi Joseph Close.
“I don’t want to say anything for now. The story will be told after my kids are found. Just pray for us, please,” the weary-looking father, Aneru Mutana, said abruptly before he went back into a room where a relative had gone to fetch him for our correspondent.
 While this reporter was waiting for Aneru, his wife was heard telling some people that the nanny’s sister once came to her shop. She also declined to speak to City Round on the incident.
Our correspondent, who also visited the school around 9am on Friday, met an employee of the school, who witnessed the incident.
 The source explained that the family newly employed the nanny and authorised her to pick the kids from the school.
According to the source, Busayo came to pick them around 6pm on Monday shortly after the school closed for the day.        
The source stated that trouble started around 7pm when the eldest brother of the victims came to ask for them.
“The eldest brother was told that the nanny had come to pick them. The brother said neither the nanny nor his siblings were at home. When the nanny’s line was called, it indicated that it was switched off. Then they called the mother on the phone and she rushed down from her shop; her husband also came.

“We learnt they got the nanny through the children’s grandmother. They were not kidnapped from the school. It was an authorised nanny who came for them. The mother introduced the nanny to her children’s class teachers.
“The first time the nanny came to pick them, we challenged her and spoke to the mother on the phone and she confirmed that she had authorised her. The major problem is that the parents don’t have the details of the nanny. They employed her about eight days before the incident. She probably gave them a fake address and they did not verify her profile,” the source said.
The source also explained that a closed circuit television mounted on the school revealed how the nanny entered the school premises and left with the children, adding that the abduction was not the fault of the management.
The abducted children
The source added, “We opened the gate for the nanny to gain entry into the school premises that evening. The CCTV showed how she was making a call inside a classroom, but I don’t know the details of the phone call. After getting the children, she left the premises.      
 “Some officials from the Ministry of Education have visited the school this morning (Friday) as a result of the incident. What is painful is that the school’s name is being tagged with the abduction whereas it was not our fault.
 “The school sympathises with the family. Staff members have visited them. I believe by God’s grace, the children will be found.”
In a notice pasted on the school wall and signed by the proprietress, Mrs. A. O. Joseph, the management urged parents to learn from the incident and double-check the profiles of caregivers before entrusting children in their care.
It read in part, “Sequel to the incident involving two of our pupils, we write to inform you that it was not as a result of any form of negligence or breach of security on the part of the school. It is simply a case of abduction in which parents do not have any background information about the supposed caregiver they employed.
“We are in distress as a school because two of our precious jewels are involved and this is a hard blow to us. We implore all parents to join us as we pray for the safe return of these children.”

 He said, “On November 26, 2018 at about 1930hrs (7.30pm), one Aneru Mutana of Olusola Olude Close, Gbagada Phase II, came to the station with his wife and reported that at 1800hrs (6pm) when he came back from work, he could not find his home help, named Busayo, said to be about 18 years old; his daughter, Nadia Mutana; and son, Khalifa Mutana. He stated further that he called the home help’s phone line but it was switched off.”

Touda said nine girls had been kidnapped in the village of Blaharde and seven more in Bague.

The Boko Haram insurgency is in its ninth year and has left 20,000 people dead and 2.6 million displaced.
The group has also targeted soldiers and civilians in separate attacks in neighbouring Chad and Niger.
The latest abductions come two days after seven local employees of a French drilling firm and a government official were killed in southeast Niger after suspected Boko Haram gunmen stormed their compound.
That attack shattered months of relative calm in the Diffa region near the Lake Chad basin, a strategic area where the borders of four countries converge.
Last week, NGOs marked 500 days since the July 2017 kidnapping of 33 women and six boys at NGalewa, another Diffa village, renewing calls for the government to step up efforts to secure their release.
Boko Haram has repeatedly attacked Diffa, a region of some 600,000 inhabitants over the past four years, displacing around half of the local population, according to NGOs.

8th November 2018,Gunmen abduct four Catholic priests in Delta,"Ochei Matthew, Theophilus Onojeghen, John Charles and Gbenga Odogun
Gunmen on Tuesday  abducted four Catholic priests between Agbor and Umutu in Ukwani Local Government Area of Delta State.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the priests were on their way to Uhielle in Ekpoma, Edo State, for an alumni meeting when they were kidnapped by the gunmen.
A source identified the victims as Rev Frs Victor Adigboluja of the Ijebu Ode diocese; Anthony Otegbola, Abeokuta Diocese; Joseph Ediae, Benin Archdiocese; and Emmanuel Obadjere, Warri Diocese. 
Another account stated that the priests were returning from their annual class meeting that took place in Warri on Monday and Tuesday to mark their 10th priestly ordination.
They were said to be on the way to the seminary of All Saints, Uhiele-Ekpoma, to celebrate with the seminary community when the gunmen waylaid them and took them away.
The Public Relations Officer of the Delta State Police Command, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, confirmed the kidnap, but did not give further details.      
Aniamaka said it had not beenascertained if the victims were kidnapped in Delta State or at Urhonigbe in neighbouring Edo State, adding that the command was intensifying efforts to unravel the circumstances of the kidnap.
The Delta State Commissioner of Police, Mr Muhammad Mustafa, later confirmed the abduction of the priests to PUNCH Metro on Wednesday, and gave an assurance that they would be rescued.
One of our correspondents gathered that vehicles conveying the priests had been recovered by a team of anti-kidnapping policemen drafted from Delta and Edo states.
Meanwhile, the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has condemned alleged the kidnap of the four Catholic priests by herdsmen in Delta State.
In a statement made available by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Terver Akase, on Wednesday, Ortom described the abduction of the priests as “barbaric, dehumanising and shameful.”
The statement quoted the governor to have wondered why armed herdsmen had chosen to make harmless clergymen targets of attacks, and stressed that the motive of the perpetrators was more than mere grazing of cattle.
The governor said the people of Benue State were still mourning the killing of two Catholic priests and 17 worshippers by herdsmen in Mbalom, Gwer East Local Government Area of Benue State earlier this year.        
He urged the security agencies to act swiftly to ensure the release of the kidnapped priests in Delta State.
Ortom called on Nigerians to rise in condemnation of persistent attacks on innocent people, particularly the current spate of violence against the clergy.
The governor stated that the resolve of herdsmen to sack communities and claim ancestral land belonging to the people was threatening the existence of Nigeria.  Related News   Gunmen kill policeman, kidnap caretaker chairman in Taraba   Lagos couple kidnaps selves, demands N5m ransom from relatives  Woman abducts two siblings in Lagos community   
He warned that if not checked, the activities of armed herdsmen would affect the smooth conduct of the 2019 elections in parts of the country.
Ortom said the government and people of Benue State were standing in prayers with the Catholic dioceses of Benin, Warri, Ijebu Ode and Abuja, where the four abducted priests came from.
In another development, a brother of the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Matthew Kolawole, his wife and two others were reportedly abducted on Monday on the Oshokoshoko-Kabba Road by hoodlums, who appeared in army and police uniforms.
This was made known on the floor of the state House of Assembly on Tuesday following the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance moved by the Speaker.      
He, however, did not reveal details of the kidnapping and if contact had been made with the family.
Consequently, the House called on the state government to intervene and quickly arrest the resurgence of high-level kidnapping and armed robbery on the Lokoja-Obajana, Oshokoshoko-Kabba and other roads in the state.
The House also urged the state government to help equip the police with more high-tech communication and security gadgets to enhance crime detection and prevention in the state.
The motion, which was presented by Oluwatoyin Lawal (PDP, Yagba West) on behalf of the Speaker, drew the attention of the state government to the resurgence of criminal activities in the state.
The motion urged security agencies, especially the police, to up their game in ensuring security of lives and property in the state, adding that more security personnel should be deployed to flashpoints.
Seconding the motion, Musa Omiata (APC, Yagba East) said in the past, Kogi was home to armed robbers and kidnappers.
He added that the intervention of the state government through equipping the police and other security agencies brought relative peace, making the state to become one of the most peaceful in the country.  
Omiata, however, regretted the resurgence of criminal activities in the state in the last two months, saying the Egbe-Isanlu and Obajana-Kabba roads had become robbers’ dens again.
Supporting the motion, Edoko Moses-Ododo recounted how last week at Ojodu on the Itobe-Anyigba road in the Ofu Local Government Area of the state, motorists were robbed and kidnapped in broad daylight.
The Deputy Speaker, Hassan Abdullahi, urged security agencies to wake up to their responsibility of securing lives and property, and argued that rather than concentrating on major roads, the security agents should be deployed in lonely roads.

5th November 2018,UPDATED: 79 school students abducted in anglophone Cameroon,"Seventy-nine school students were kidnapped on Monday in an English-speaking region of Cameroon where separatists are fighting an armed campaign for independence, a government source said.
The students were abducted along with their principal, a teacher and a driver, the official said, as a source at the school confirmed the kidnapping of the pupils.
They were enrolled at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, capital of Cameroon’s Northwest Region — one of two regions hit by attacks by anglophone militants that have met with a brutal crackdown by the authorities. 
“The search for the hostages has been launched — every man has been called in,” the government source said, speaking after a crisis meeting.
READ ALSO: Messi ‘icing on the cake’ for dangerous Barcelona –Spalletti
The kidnapping — the gravest incident so far in 13 months of unrest — coincides with an upsurge of political tensions in the majority French-speaking country.      
It comes after elections on October 7 that saw President Paul Biya, 85, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for 35 years, secure a seventh term in office.
Biya was credited with 71.3 percent of the vote, although the ballot was marred by allegations of widespread fraud, low voter turnout and violence.
He takes his oath of office on Tuesday.
Around a fifth of Cameroon’s 22 million people are English-speaking — a minority whose presence dates back to the colonial period.
Cameroon, once a German colony, was divided between Britain and France after World War I.  Related News   Photos: Cameroonian mother abandons newborn baby, drops note  Cameroon begins online visa application service April 30  Canada commends peace moves in Cameroon   
The French colony gained independence in 1960, becoming Cameroon. The following year, the British-ruled Southern Cameroons was amalgamated into it, giving rise to the Northwest and Southwest regions.
But resentment at perceived discrimination at the hands of the francophone majority, especially in education and the judiciary, began to build.        
In 2016, demands for greater autonomy grew but met with a rebuff by Biya.
As radicals took ascendancy, the anglophone movement declared the creation of the “Republic of Ambazonia” in the Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Region on October 1, 2017.
No country has recognised the self-declared state.
The separatists have gunned down troops and police, boycotted and torched schools and attacked other perceived symbols of the Cameroonian state.
The authorities have responded with a massive crackdown by police and troops.
At least 400 civilians have been killed this year as well as more than 175 members of the security forces, according to a toll compiled by non-governmental organisations.
According to UN figures, 246,000 people in the Southwest Region have fled their homes, and 25,000 have sought shelter in neighbouring Nigeria, many of them living hand-to-mouth in the forests.      
Estimates of displaced people in the Northwest Region are not available.

10th August 2018,Militants abduct five aid workers in Somalia – Officials,"Suspected Al-Shabab militants have kidnapped five aid workers in southern Somalia in the latest series of abduction in the Horn of the African nation, an official said on Friday.
Mohamed Aflow, Director of the Somali National Intelligence and Security Agency in Bay region, confirmed the abduction of the Somali Red Crescent Society workers on Friday.
Aflow told journalists in Baidoa, capital of Bay region, that the aid workers were distributing nutrition supplies in Busle village on the outskirts of Baidoa when they were kidnapped by the militants.
He said efforts are underway to secure the release of the three female and two male aid workers. 
There was no comment from the Somali Red Crescent Society on the abduction.
No group has claimed responsibility for the latest abduction, but Al-Shabab which is fighting to topple the government has been targeting aid workers for political gain, sometimes demanding ransom in order to free the hostages.

Oweifa, who hails from Burmoundi in Ekpetiama clan, Yenagoa Local Government Area of the state, was whisked away around 3:30pm.
A source said the gunmen succeeded in capturing Oweifa after they forcibly entered the vehicle he was riding in with his personal assistant.      
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the gunmen overpowered Oweifa’s PA and threw him out of the vehicle before whisking Oweifa away to an unknown destination.
He added that the abduction had created panic among family members as they had yet to hear from the abductors a day after the incident.
Also, an elder brother to Dudafa, Ineye Dudafa, confirmed the abduction, saying his abductors had yet to contact his family members.
He appealed to the kidnappers to release his brother unconditionally, adding that fear had gripped the family since the lecturer’s abduction.
Ineye said, “We are passing through a traumatised period because of this unfortunate abduction of my brother. I appeal to the security agencies to do everything possible to get him released.”
Efforts to get police confirmation were unsuccessful as calls made to the mobile of  the spokesman for the state Police Command, Mr. Asinim Butswat, rang out several times.
Meanwhile, gunmen suspected to be robbers dressed in police uniforms have murdered one of the PDP youth leaders in Imo State, Chidi Eburuaja.        
Eburuaja, until his death, was the party’s youth leader in Owerre Nkworji, the political ward of a House of Representatives Committee Chairman on Banking and Currency, Jones Onyereri.

Owerre Nkworji is in the Nkwerre Local Government Area of the state. His kinsman, Emeka Njoku who confirmed Eburuaja’s death, said the deceased drove to a nearby pharmacy to buy drugs for his ailing sister when he was ambushed by the gunman.
Njoku said, “Three armed men dressed in police uniforms stormed a bar at about 8:45pm.They tried to snatch a vehicle from the victim but they could not succeed and they shot him.
Eburuaja was first taken to Joint Hospital, Amaigbo, but was later transferred to UNTH Enugu where he died on Saturday morning.
SUNDAY PUNCH learnt that the gunmen later snatched a car without number plate to escape. All effort made to get the reaction of the spokesperson for the police in the state, Andrew Enwerem, were abortive.
Recall that few days ago, a leader of the All Progressives Congress in the state, Amos Akano, who hailed from the same Nkwerre council area, was kidnapped and murdered by gunmen.

A group of men suspected to be herdsmen has abducted a farmer identified as Edith Lawrence and inflicted injury on several persons, including another farmer, Blessing Chimele.
The incident happened on Thursday in Ihuoba community in the Ahoada East Local Government Area of Rivers State.
A source from the area told Southern City News on Sunday that the herdsmen led their cattle into the victims’ farm, adding that when the women raised the alarm, one of them was kidnapped while others were injured. 
It was gathered that the herdsmen attacked some inhabitants of the community with daggers, bow and arrow before they made away with Blessing, whose whereabouts remained unknown.
“The herdsmen allowed their cows to roam into people’s farms and when the women, who were working in their farms, saw what was happening, they began to shout and called people to help them.
“The herdsmen attacked some of the people that came to the place. Community people were attacked with daggers, bows and arrows. Many were injured. One of the farmers, Blessing Chimele, was injured.      
“Also, one woman (Edith Lawrence) was kidnapped by the herdsmen. As we speak, there is no news about the woman’s whereabouts. She has not been released,” the source, who simply identified himself as James, added.
James explained that some of the inhabitants of the community, mostly women, later embarked on a peaceful protest along the East-West Road axis of Ahoada East, calling for the release of Blessing.

3rd June 2018,Gunmen in military uniform abduct Agip retiree’s wife,"Simon Utebor
Unidentified gunmen in military uniform have abducted Madam Walama Otikiri, wife of a prominent chief and retired senior official of the Nigerian Agip Oil Company.
The gunmen stormed the coastal city of Town-Brass in Brass Local Government Area of Bayelsa State on Friday and seized the 60-year-old woman.
The incident, which occurred about 11pm on Friday, reportedly threw the Sambo-Ama, Twon-Brass community into confusion with the gunmen shooting sporadically for over 30 minutes to scare residents. 
Community sources said the abduction of Madam Otikiri came a few days after an in-law to a member of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly, Israel Sunny-Goli, was released from the kidnappers’ den.
The gunmen, according to sources, entered the community by water with two speedboats and shot their way in and out of the community after the operation which lasted for about 45 minutes.
Confirming the development in a statement issued on Saturday, Sunny-Goli condemned the abduction of one of his constituents, Otikiri, by unidentified gunmen.      
Sunny-Goli described the abduction as not only malicious and senseless, but utterly inhumane. He, therefore, called for her immediate release.
The lawmaker said, “Kidnapping has become the greatest monster bedevilling us as a people, and it is now imperative that we sit together at a round-table (conference) to discuss how best we can bring it into extinction.
“It is against this backdrop that I wish to call on security agencies to quickly swing into action in order to rescue the innocent woman from the hand of her abductors as well as bring the perpetrators of this heinous act to justice.”
When contacted, the spokesman for the Bayelsa State Police Command, Mr. Asinim Butswat, said he was not aware of the abduction.
Butswat, however, promised to return the call after confirming from the police division in Twon-Brass. But as of the time of filing this report, he had yet to do so.

Gunmen on Sunday in Kaduna, the Kaduna State capital, abducted a former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Bagudu Hirse, in front of the residence of a relation of President Muhammadu Buhari.
The incident took place in front of Alhaji Mamman Daura’s residence on Inuwa Wada area at Ungwan-Rimi, Kaduna North Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
Daura, it was learnt, was at home with the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, when the kidnappers came fuelling speculation that the abductors might have mistaken Hirse for the former. 
The house where Hirse was kidnapped is about 500 metres from Inuwa Wada Road, close to the INEC headquarters in the state capital.
According to a source, the former minister who was said to be in the company of his friend, had gone to pay a condolence visit to the family of the late 18th Sultan of Sokoto, Ibrahim Dasuki, on Kabiru Road.
It learnt that while coming from Dasuki residence, he made a stopover at the house of Mamman Daura, who was said to be home with some visitors and family members.      
An eyewitness account said that the kidnappers, said to be wearing mask, accosted the former minister and asked him to enter their car.
Hirse attempted to resist but the kidnappers forced him into the car. This attracted the people around the place to move towards the scene but one of the kidnappers brought out a gun to scare them away.
One eyewitness said, “They asked him to get into their car but he attempted to resist by demanding for explanations from them but when people started approaching the scene,  one of them raised up a gun and made an attempt to pull the trigger but it did not respond.
“He tried it the second time and it failed. It was the third time a shot was released into the air and everybody scamper for safety.
“It was after then, they forced him into the car,  removed his babariga (flowing gown) and cap and threw them on the ground. They thereafter drove away.”  Related News   Kidnapped Imo bizman found dead in Anambra after N10m ransom payment  Rampaging gunmen kill three policemen at Anambra checkpoint  Gunmen shoot Rivers  youth  leader dead in father’s compound   
One of the security guards around the house, who pleaded anonymity, said it was not clear if the gunmen had mistaken Hirse for Daura.
The source added while Hirse was being kidnapped Daura was “inside with other dignitaries like the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari when the kidnappers came.”        
Immediately the kidnappers made away with the former minister, Daura was informed of the attack and more security agents were deployed to the house.
An unnamed friend of Hirse, who was reportedly shot by the gunmen, had been taken to an undisclosed hospital in Kaduna for treatment.
The Kaduna State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Usman Aliyu, confirmed the incident, adding that investigations had started.
The ex-minister’s brother, Chief John Hirse, also confirmed the abduction.
“I got home from church to read the message informing me of the kidnap of my brother, Bagudu, on my phone,” John, a former federal permanent secretary and current District Head of Mangu, in Plateau State, told NAN in Jos.
John said he was expecting further details “on the sad incident.”
“You have to exercise patience and call back later for more information and further developments,” he said.

15th November 2016,Gunmen abduct retired principal in Bayelsa,"Simon Utebor, Yenagoa
Some yet-to-be identified gunmen have abducted a 72-year-old retired principal, Chief Sunday Festus, in Bayelsa State.
It was learnt that the septuagenarian was abducted by the four-man gang in his residence at Bomo clan, in the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of the state on Monday.
His son, Leigh, confirmed the abduction. 
Leigh said his father, who is diabetic, was critically ill when his abductors whisked him away to an unknown destination.
He said, “The incident occurred at about 3.26am. The four-man gang of kidnappers arrived at the Foinbiri waterside at about 3.10am and went straight to my father’s residence.
“They broke the door protectors and forced him out of his room into a waiting speedboat.      
“My father’s abduction followed a big bang on his door. They shouted and commanded that he should follow them. Attempt to resist the assailants by Ikiotari Festus – my father’s 13-year-old son – left him with injuries. They hit him on the head with the butts of their guns.”
Leigh averred that the “heartless kidnappers” dragged his father on the ground to the waterside, shooting repeatedly into the air to scare residents and to scuttle any resistance from the community.
He added that after they (abductors) succeeded in forcibly taking their victim, they headed towards Opuama community in the area.

14th November 2016,Gunmen abduct 61-year-old widow in Lagos,"Afeez Hanafi
Gunmen around the creeks of Ishawo, in the Ikorodu area of Lagos, unleashed terror on Friday, abducting a 61-year-old widow, Mrs. Victoria Falodi, who lives on Iyewa Olorunsogo Estate.
PUNCH Metro learnt that a neighbour, identified only as Baba Ayomide, had gone to the woman’s residence around 8am on that day to charge his mobile phone.
It was gathered that the woman had collected the phone from him and had wanted to enter her house when the bandits accosted her and whisked her into the bush while Baba Ayomide was beaten up. 
He was said to have been arrested after the case was reported at the Owutu Police Division.
 Victoria’s daughter, Fola, said her mother and her vacated the residence a few months ago after a failed attempt to kidnap the sexagenarian.
She added that they came back thinking that the law enforcement agencies had curbed kidnapping in the area, adding that the latest incident proved that they were wrong.      
She said, “A neighbour of ours called Baba Ayomide came to charge his mobile phone. She came out and collected the phone from him and was about to enter the house when three men suddenly appeared and attacked her. She begged them but they didn’t listen. They whisked her away. They came with an axe, a cutlass and a gun.
“There was an attempt to kidnap her a few months ago. We left home for about a month. We came back thinking the community was calm. We have not heard anything from the gang. She is a widow.”  Related News   Kidnapped Imo bizman found dead in Anambra after N10m ransom payment  Rampaging gunmen kill three policemen at Anambra checkpoint  Gunmen shoot Rivers  youth  leader dead in father’s compound   
Fola’s elder sister, Mrs. Dorcas Oyedepo, urged security agencies to intensify effort at rescuing her mother.
“The army and the police have been making efforts to rescue her. They have been patrolling the community. We want the Nigerian Navy to be involved to so the officers can penetrate the waterways. Members of Oodua People Congress have joined in the rescue efforts,” she said.
 A resident, who identified himself only as Tunde, lamented the spate of kidnapping in the community.
“Three months ago, an immigration officer was kidnapped in this area. Last Saturday, they attacked a resident, but did not succeed. Their target has a piggery. They shot three pigs dead. Around 12pm on Saturday, they invaded the community again,” he added.
A landlord on the estate, who was a victim of the gang on two occasions, said the incident had negatively affected the psyche of his family members, adding that he had relocated.        
He said, “After I was kidnapped for the second time, I became convinced that the place is no longer safe for my family and me. The second time they came for me, it was in the presence of my wife and children. They are still nursing the trauma. I had to rent a two-bedroomed apartment somewhere else. I also know of a nieghbour that had packed out of the estate.”

A resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the gunmen did not shoot in order not to alert anyone, adding that it was the woman’s husband who went to the police station.
He said, “It was around 10pm on Thursday. Most of us had locked our gates. The gunmen went to the apartments of their victims and ordered them out at gunpoint. They did not use the gates and they did not shoot so as not to arouse suspicion.
“It was after they had left that news got to me that two persons were abducted. The policemen came to this place, but the gunmen had escaped. We suspect that there could be an insider giving information to the kidnappers.

“The two residents have yet to return home. Their families may have been contacted for ransoms, but nobody knows.”
A police source at the division said the operatives saw the footsteps of the gunmen, adding that their escape was successful because they came on a speedboat.        
He said, “The woman’s husband, Eze, came to the station around 11pm to report that his wife and another neighbour had been abducted.
“Policemen from the division mounted a stop-and-search points on the roads, but there was no result.
“We came across the kidnappers footsteps along the bank of the Amuwo Odofin river. That made the arrest difficult because the hoodlums came and escaped through the waterways. They broke the fence and attacked their victims.”
Our correspondent gathered that the matter had been transferred to the State Department of Criminal Intelligence and Investigation, Yaba.
The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, confirmed the incident.
She said, “The case is under investigation. Effort is in top gear to get the abductees freed.”

Some gunmen on Friday kidnapped an employee of a commercial printing press in Ikeja, Mr. Emmanuel Brown, in the Agric, Ikorodu area of the state.
Our correspondent learnt that Brown, who was driving home with his wife and daughter, was attacked by the gunmen at about 7pm around Church bus stop, Agric.
The assailants reportedly took the family hostage in their car, whisking them away to a junction in the neighbouring Imota area, where they let go of the wife and daughter on the same evening. 
The matter was said to have been reported at the Imota Police Division and the Area N Command, Ijede.
A relation, who did not want her name in print, said the gunmen had called the family and demanded a ransom of N100m.
She said, “The kidnappers called in on Saturday morning and demanded a ransom. We begged them that we could not raise such amount. We are still negotiating with them. They have not yet agreed to lower the ransom. On Sunday, they called in again, telling us that we were wasting their time. But we can only beg them as we cannot raise such huge amount.”      
Another relation said the family members were making frantic efforts to put some amount together for the kidnappers.
The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, confirmed the incident, adding that the state Commissioner of Police, Fatai Owoseni, had directed a discreet investigation into the case.

5th October 2016,"Gunmen ignore police presence, abduct  ex-minister, hubby in Kaduna","Adelani Adepegba and Godwin Isenyo
A former Minister of Environment, Mrs. Lawrencia Laraba-Mallam, and her husband, Pius, were on Monday evening abducted by gunmen along the Abuja–Kaduna Expressway.
It was learnt that the couple were on their way from Abuja when they ran into a roadblock, mounted by the hoodlums, along the Jere area of the highway around 7pm.
The incident occurred in spite of the drafting of 510 riot policemen on the road by the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, on August 5, 2016 to check kidnappings and other criminal activities. 
The deployment, which was backed by 40 patrol vehicles and armoured personnel carriers, was expected to man dark spots and vulnerable points along the road which had become notorious for kidnapping and other violent crimes.
Idris, who was represented by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of Operation, Habila Joshak, during the inauguration of ‘Operation Maximum Safety,’ directed the operatives to curb all forms of criminal activities in the area and provide security for commuters and residents of surrounding communities.
The deployment of the policemen followed the abduction of the Sierra Leonean Deputy High Commissioner to Nigeria, Maj. Gen. Alfred Nelson (retd.), on the Abuja-Kaduna highway in July, 2016.      
The Force Public Relations Officer, Donald Awunah, could not be reached for comment on the failure of the policemen to prevent the kidnap of the former minister and her husband.
He did not respond to calls to his mobile and he had yet to reply to an SMS sent to him as of the time of filing this report.
Meanwhile, the kidnappers have established contact with the family and demanded a ransom of N10m.
A source, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity on Tuesday, said, “The incident occurred between 7pm and 7.30pm. The driver of the car was spared and it was when he returned home and narrated the story that we got to know that the former minister and the husband had been kidnapped.  Related News   Kidnapped Imo bizman found dead in Anambra after N10m ransom payment  Kaduna LP dissociates self from Apapa-faction, suspends three  Kaduna gov-elect promises safe media space for journalists   
“They (kidnappers) made contact with the family around 10am this morning (Tuesday) and said we must bring N10m before they can release them.”
One of our correspondents, who visited the home of the Mallams on Tuesday, observed that visitors and well-wishers had been trooping to their residence in Kaduna.
The family members refused to talk on the abduction for security reasons.        
“It is very possible that the kidnappers didn’t know their identities, otherwise the ransom could have been higher than the N10m demanded.
“You know these people can be callous; the moment they know the true identity of  the victims, they can jack up the ransom,” a family source confided in one of our correspondents.
The Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, Aliyu  Usman, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, confirmed the incident, saying the former minister and her husband  were whisked  away  while the driver was spared.
Usman said the command was doing all it could to ensure that the couple regained their freedom.
Lawrencia was the National President of the Catholic Women Organisation of Nigeria before she was appointed a minister by ex-President Goodluck Jonathan.

Onyebuchi is the son of the Dean of Graduate School, Prof. Emeka Okwueze.
After abducting Onyebuchi, the gunmen had while escaping, inflicted injuries on a lecturer in the Department of Physics, Dr Anthony George and his wife who were driving in and got caught up in the attack. 
The gunmen were said to have gained entry to the staff quarters through the porous boundary with the creeks of Calabar estuaries.
Earlier in May 2016, gunmen suspected to be militants had through the same route stormed the quarters and abducted the wife of a lecturer, Mrs. Nancy Ndifon alongside her daughter, Oyebah. The same gang also abducted a medical doctor, David Iniama, in the same premises.
Southern City News learnt on Friday that the gunmen had stormed the premises of the dean who was unavailable at the time of the attack, broke into his house and made away with his Plasma television and his 24-year-old son who was the only one at home.      
After abducting Onyebuchi, the anonymous source said that the gunmen had on their way out at about 8.15pm shot Dr. Anthony George on his right hand, while his wife sustained bullet injuries on the left knee.
It was learnt that both are however responding to treatment at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital.

In his reaction, the Vice-Chancellor of UNICAL, Prof Zana Akpagu, who visited the homes of the affected staff, promised to do all within the purview of his office to ensure the release of those kidnapped and also fish out the kidnappers.
He also pledged to work with the relevant security agencies to ensure continued safety of lives and property on campus.
In the bid to checkmate future occurrence of the event, the Deputy Chief Security Officer of UNICAL, Mr. Jarlath Abang, in a statement of Friday disclosed that several security measures had been put in place by the management of the institution in conjunction with the Cross River State Government to ensure safety of lives.        
“The measures covered and implemented in the joint initiative include among others , demolition of all shanties at the waterfront by the Cross River State Government,  prohibition of fishing and farming at the water front, displacement of illegal occupants and constant patrol of the quarters both by security operatives on foot and vehicles,” he said.
The Deputy Chief Security Officer attributed the delay in the distress call as a major reason for the kidnappers’ tentative gain.

Less than three days after the Department of State Services and the Benue State Security Council paraded six children rescued from kidnappers, three other children between the ages of three and six have been abducted by gunmen in the Adeke area of Makurdi, Benue State.
The Benue State Police Command, on Friday, paraded an alleged kidnapper, Amos Etubi, who was said to be a student of the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, along with 18 others accused of armed robbery and car-snatching in various parts of the state.
The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Moses Yamu, who paraded the suspects at the Police Headquarters, Makurdi, said Etubi was arrested after kidnapping one Usman Abdul Akwu, a businessman. 
The suspect, who was said to be a 200-level student, was reportedly arrested while trying to take the ransom dropped by the family of the victim at the South Core junction on the university premises.
According to Yamu, an alleged human trafficker with dual citizenship of Nigeria and Cameroon, Israel Lame, was also arrested while trying to board a vehicle to Lagos State with two young girls aged 20 and 24.
An eyewitness told SUNDAY PUNCH that the latest victims of kidnapping in the state were a boy and two of his sisters, who were abducted on their way to their family’s vegetable farm along the road in the early hours of penultimate Saturday.      
According the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, two persons alighted from a vehicle with guns, ordered the children into the car and drove towards Adoka and Ankpa Road.
The eyewitness said, “I thought they were customers because I was also on my vegetable farm and customers sometimes stop to buy leaves from us. When I saw them, I did not suspect anything until they were being taken into the car and they were shouting. I also started shouting and running away but before people could help, they (the gunmen) had gone.”
Yamu confirmed the incident in an interview with our correspondent, adding that the police had launched an investigation into the case.

The oil workers were abducted on Friday on their way back to their office in Port Harcourt from a technical job they had gone for in Omoku.
Saturday PUNCH learnt that the unknown gunmen had ambushed the bus conveying the oil workers along Omoku-Elele Road and hijacked the vehicle at about 12.20pm.

1st September 2016,Gunmen in military uniform abduct three Lagos estate landlords,"Olaleye Aluko 
There is tension in New Haven Estate, Igbelaju, in the Iba area of  Lagos State, after some gunmen in military uniform abducted three landlords in the estate.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the gunmen attacked the estate on Saturday and on Monday.
Two of the landlords were reportedly abducted while going to their workplaces. 
It was gathered that in the attack on Saturday, a woman, identified only as Mrs. Nwoche, was abducted from her residence and had yet to be released.
Our correspondent learnt that as residents grappled with the shock, the gunmen on Monday at about 11am, reportedly waylaid two other landlords driving out of the estate and ordered them to the creek at gunpoint.
While one of the victims was identified only as Mr. Chima, the name of the other had yet to be ascertained.      
The matter was said to have been reported at the Ojo Police Division, which sent operatives of the Rapid Response Squad, to comb the area.
When PUNCH Metro visited the area on Wednesday, it was gathered that the three landlords had yet to be found.
Although most of the estate residents were unwilling to comment on the incident, a commercial motorcyclist, who gave his name only as Ebuka, showed our correspondent the narrow bushy path through which the gunmen reportedly sneaked into the estate.
He said, “I did not witness the Saturday incident because it was around 9pm and people only heard some gunshots and ran inside their houses. The gunmen went away with a woman who stayed in a luxury apartment. She has yet to return.
“On Monday, the hoodlums came out in the morning. You would think they were soldiers who came to inspect the area. I saw them in military uniform standing near the plank bridge and holding a rifle.

“I was passing by with a passenger, but I saw that one of them held a pump-action rifle. Seconds later, they stopped two men who were driving out of the estate. The men were in different Sport Utility Vehicles, but were behind each other.
“They ordered them to come out and follow them. That was how they led the victims away into the swamp. We have yet to see either of them. Everyone is afraid. We suspect that the hoodlums are the militants who escaped from the military bombardments of the creeks.”        
A worker on a building site, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “I was going to the site when I saw the soldiers standing by the bridge. They looked as if they had come to make an arrest.
“No one knew they were kidnappers. The family members of the victims have not been contacted. They are still in the dark. Some residents have fled from the estate for fear of abduction.
“Policemen in three vans came after the incident to patrol the area. They have been patrolling the estate since Monday, but the abducted landlords have yet to return.”
Our correspondent observed an armoured tank belonging to the RRS driving into the swamp as he was leaving the estate.
The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, confirmed the attack. She said operatives of the command were already on a rescue mission.
She said, “The command received the report that some men in military camouflage came under the guise of making an arrest and whisked away a landlord.
“Effort is on to ensure his release and subsequent arrest of the suspects.”

The wife of a chairmanship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the forthcoming Saturday October 8 election in Ogun State, Mrs. Kudirat Balogun, has been abducted.
She was abducted at her home on Sunday by four gunmen.
Kudirat’s husband, Gafar Balogun, is eyeing the chairmanship seat of Ewekoro Local Government Area of the state and was not around when the gunmen struck. 
PUNCH Metro gathered that the assailants arrived at the Baloguns residence on Sekoni Street in the Olomore area of Abeokuta around 8pm.
They were said to have pretended to be visitors, asking after the APC chairmanship candidate.
The gunmen reportedly met his 13- year- old son, Kehinde, who never knew their intention until they drew out their guns.      
The teenager told journalists that he was led at gunpoint into the sitting room where his mother, who was preparing food in the kitchen, walked into the hands of the abductors.
The gunmen reportedly took him and his mother outside, and at gunpoint, led them into a Toyota Matrix brought by them.
They took the victim and left Kehinde.
The kidnappers reportedly told Kehinde while leaving, “your father is a sure person, your mummy will return soon.”
Kehinde, thereafter, raised the alarm in the neighbourhood.
His father later raced home when he was informed on the telephone about the incident.
Kudirat’s husband said he had reported the case at the Lafenwa Police Station, from where it was transferred to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad.        
As of the time of filing this report, the abductors had yet to contact the family.
The Ogun State acting Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident.
He said, “The Commissioner of Police has ordered the anti-kidnapping unit to take over the case and investigations have commenced into the matter.”

17th August 2016,Gunmen abduct uncle of rape victim in A’Ibom,"Etim Ekpimah, Uyo
Dr. Ime Stephen, the uncle of 15-year-old Mary Udo, who was allegedly raped at gunpoint by a police inspector in Akwa Ibom, has been abducted.
Ime was kidnapped at his house on Tuesday around 3am.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the human rights activist, who had been fighting for justice for Udo, was whisked away by some masked gunmen. 
The gunmen reportedly gained entrance into the house by breaking through the wall from the backyard.
The victim’s wife, Gloria, told our correspondent that while three of the gunmen entered into the house, others waited outside.
She stated that when the gunmen entered into their apartment, they locked her and her child in a room.      
She said, “Three of the gunmen entered our apartment with their faces covered. They gained entrance by breaking the wall from the backyard.
“They did not talk; they just pushed me, my son and a visitor into one room. One of the three gunmen stood at the door, threatening to shoot if we made a noise or shout.”
PUNCH Metro gathered that Ime’s abduction was not unconnected with the rape of Udo, his niece.
It was learnt that on July 22, shortly after 15-year-old Udo was raped by the police inspector, the Divisional Police Officer at Mkpat Enin Police Division, Mkpat Enin Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, sent two clerics and some police officers to plead with Ime to let the matter go.
The clerics, who described themselves as senior apostles, reportedly begged him to forgive the inspector, saying the case was a big shame to the Nigeria Police Force.  Related News   Kidnapped Imo bizman found dead in Anambra after N10m ransom payment  Rampaging gunmen kill three policemen at Anambra checkpoint  Gunmen shoot Rivers  youth  leader dead in father’s compound   
Ime was said to have told the clerics that the matter was a serious one and he could not let it go.
He had said, “This is a very serious thing – a police inspector raping a 15-year-old girl at gunpoint. This is more than robbery. He not only raped the girl, he kidnapped her for three days and collected a ransom of N10,000 as bail sum.”        
Our correspondent had on August 13, 2016 reported that Ime escaped an assassination attempt at his house at Nyaodiong village in Mkpat Enin LGA on August 9 at 10.30pm.
He had, in a petition to the Commissioner of Police, Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Murtala Mani, alleged threat to his life, the lives of his family members, attempted arson of his new house as well as malicious damage of his property.
Ime is the Director General, Centre for International Integrity, Peace and Development in Nigeria.
Ime had on Friday told our correspondent that he was with the CP to complain of frequent attacks on him and also on how to get justice for Udo.
Mani, when contacted, said he had yet to confirm the report as he was in Calabar.
He said, “I am yet to confirm the incident because I am in Calabar. I heard of it.”

6th August 2016,Gunmen abduct octogenarian father of Bayelsa lawmaker,"Simon Utebor, Yenagoa
Some unidentified gunmen have abducted an octogenarian, Mr. Watson Iti, in Bayelsa State.
The victim is the father of the lawmaker representing Brass Constituency II in the State House of Assembly, Mr. Watson-Alfred Belemote.
It was learnt that the octogenarian was abducted by four gunmen operating along the waterways of state on Saturday morning.
The victim, who hails from Okpoama kingdom of Brass Local Government Area, was reportedly whisked away while he was conveying the body of his deceased wife for burial. 
It was learnt that the incident happened about 9.25am along the Okpoama-Egweama waterways of the area.
The octogenarian was said to be conveying the remains of his wife, Belemote’s step mother, from Okpoama mortuary to Egweama, the deceased maternal home for burial as customs demand, when the gunmen struck.
A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “Watson is a respected chief in Okpoama kingdom. His wife died and her body was deposited at the Okpoama mortuary.      
“On Saturday, he was taking the body to his wife maternal home at Egweama which is about seven minutes’ away from Okpoama when gunmen attacked them.
“The gunmen were four and they were operating on a 75 horsepower boat. The chief was travelling with the casket bearing his wife’s body on a 115 horsepower speedboat. The gunmen shot four times at them and forced them to stop.”
The source said when the assailants approached the boat, they gave the boat driver machete cuts, stole handsets and other valuables belonging to the boat’s occupants and whisked the aged Watson away to an unknown destination.
Confirming the incident, the lawmaker asked the kidnappers to release his father unconditionally, alleging that the abductors “were within the community”.
He vowed he would not pay any ransom to the abductors, adding that efforts were being made to locate his father and the kidnappers.
Belemote
Belemote said, “I am asking them to release my father unconditionally because it was something done by people within. How can you kidnap an old man who was going to bury his dead wife?”
When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Asinim Butswat, confirmed the incident.
The police spokesman said the police were investigating the development."
5th August 2016,Govt has abandoned us  – Abducted Lagos monarch’s family,"Olaleye Aluko
The family members of the abducted Oniba of Iba land, Oba Goriola Oseni, say they have been left in the dark about what efforts the Lagos State Government is making to rescue the 73-year-old monarch.
The family, who spoke with PUNCH Metro on Thursday, said the government had not called them for any update or briefing on the extent of investigation 19 days after the kidnap, alleging that the government was becoming indifferent to the matter.
About 16 gun-wielding militants had, on Saturday, July 16, stormed Oseni’s palace at about 8.30pm, shooting into the air, after which they whisked him away in two speedboats. 
During the attack, four residents were shot dead, including a palace guard, identified as Sunday Okanlawon, and a barber, identified as Rilwan.
Six days after the abduction, the militants were said to have contacted the monarch’s family, demanding N500m.
It was reported on Sunday, July 24, that the family members pleaded with the Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, to assist in raising the ransom and securing their father’s release.      
Speaking with PUNCH Metro on Thursday, one of the monarch’s daughters, who did not want her name in print, said the family had yet to hear from the state government or the police.
She said, “Baba (Oseni) has not been released. We are making efforts, but we do not know what the government is doing about this. Even if an animal gets missing, you look for it, let alone the king of a town, who has spent over 40 years on the throne.
“Having contributed much to the growth of the community and the state in general, his matter should be treated with more concern. The governor and his officials have not said anything lately about what is being done on the matter. As a family, we have not seen any green light from the government; we are in the dark.”
Another relation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the kidnappers were willing to release the monarch if some money was paid.
He said, “If the state government expedited action on this, Baba should have been released.
“The kidnappers are not saying they will not release him. If the government does what is necessary, the abductors will let go of the monarch.
“The state government is not serious about this. What the government is doing now, we do not really understand. For now, God is our hope.”        
When asked whether the kidnappers had reduced the ransom, the family source said he would not want to make that public.
“The ransom is not the issue now. The kidnappers are ready to release Baba, but they want to get something. If one of the foremost rulers in the state has been abducted for 19 days and at that age, nothing significant has been done, this calls for serious attention,” he said.
The monarch’s son, Saheed, said he was not willing to comment on the incident.
The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, said on Thursday that the police were still on a rescue mission.
She said, “Investigation is ongoing. The police are on a rescue operation.”
The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Steve Ayorinde, did not pick the calls by our correspondent.
A text message sent to his phone on the incident had also yet to be replied to as of press time.

Some gunmen have abducted the traditional ruler of Iba community, Lagos State, Oba Goriola Oseni – the Oniba of Iba land.
Also abducted were a woman, her three-month-old baby, and a businessman.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the gunmen, who were suspected to be militants, stormed the community in two speedboats on Saturday around 10.30pm. 
They were said to have shot dead one of the palace guards and a motorcycle rider.
The monarch’s wife, Kuburat, who sustained gunshot injuries, was reportedly rushed to a hospital for treatment.
A resident, Ifayemi Yomi, said the gunmen announced their presence with sporadic gunshots which made everyone to scamper to safety.      
He said, “The gunmen came in at about 10pm, shooting indiscriminately. They had earlier gone to the Agbede area of Ikorodu, and tried to abduct some oil dealers; but they failed. They then made their way to Iba through the waterways.
“They went to the palace and dragged the traditional ruler out. The residents tried to prevent their entry into the palace and one of them, who worked with the Neighbourhood Watch, was shot dead. A motorcycle rider was also killed.”
Another resident, identified only as Muyiwa, said people in the area had started leaving in droves.
He said, “My wife and I initially thought vigilantes were at work, but with the persistence of the shooting, we sensed the community was under attack.
“The gunshots woke up my two children. For one hour, I was confused. My wife, the children and I held on to one another. It was this morning (Sunday) that I heard that the king was abducted by militants. They killed his guard and shot his wife in the leg.”
A source explained that the community had become volatile due to the operations of the militants, calling on the Lagos State Government and security agencies to rise up to the challenge.
He said, “It seems the militants are becoming too powerful for the government. If measures are not taken to check their excesses, they will take over all the riverine areas in Lagos and Ogun states.        
“Last week, a landlord was abducted in an estate around here. He has not been released till now because his family has not been able to raise the ransom the kidnappers demanded.
“For now, I am leaving my house until the government is able to bring the situation under control.”
Another source in the palace said policemen had been deployed in the creeks around the area.
The elder brother of the abducted monarch and the Oloto of Otto, Oba Josiah Aina, who spoke with PUNCH Metro on the phone, said the family had not been contacted for any ransom.
He said, “We have not been contacted for ransom. The monarch’s wife is receiving treatment in a Lagos hospital.”
Our correspondent gathered that earlier on Friday, the gunmen abducted a woman, her three-month-old baby and a businessman.
A source said the incident happened on Victory Estate in the Iba area.      
He said, “The gunmen came into the estate around 9pm on Friday and abducted the woman and her three months old baby.
“They demanded N30m for their release. Around 11.30pm of the same day, a businessman, Mr. Christian, was kidnapped and his family was requested to pay N30m. Someone offered them N3m for his release, but they refused.”
The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, confirmed the kidnap of the monarch.
She said the command was working with the Ogun State Police Command to rescue the victim and arrest the suspects.
She said, “It is a new trend. Because they can no longer vandalised pipelines, these militants have resorted to kidnapping. The command has been arresting them and rescuing their victims. The latest will not be different.
“The Lagos and Ogun states governments are getting involved in the operation. We are optimistic that this problem will soon come to an end.”

The case is with the police and they are investigating. We have been told that the gunmen have reached out to the family and they are demanding a ransom.”
One of Ofulue’s neighbours, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the gunmen abducted three other persons in the area on the same day.
He said, “The officer was preparing to go for a thanksgiving service last Sunday when the gunmen stormed his compound. He was abducted along with three other persons in the area.

A police source told PUNCH Metro that the gunmen were believed to be working with some people who lived in the area.

8th July 2016,Gunmen abduct former senator in Cross River,"Gunmen have abducted Sen. Patrick Ani, a former senator who represented Cross River South on the platform of the defunct National Republican Convention between 1991 and 1992.
Eyewitnesses told journalists in Calabar on Thursday that the former legislator was abducted by the gunmen on Wednesday in his herbal farm in Akpabuyo Local Government Area of the state.
Ani is the brother of a former Minister of Finance, Chief Anthony Ani.
However, ASP Irene Ugbo, the Police Public Relations Officer of Cross River Police Command, told reporters that although the incident had been reported to the police, she had yet to confirm it. 
A man working in Ani’s farm, who preferred anonymity, also confirmed that his boss was kidnapped.
He said that policemen came to the farm and promised to investigate the matter.
He could not, however, ascertain the exact time of the abduction.      
In a related development, some foreigners and Nigerians working for a multinational company were recently kidnapped in the state while their Nigerian driver was killed.
The abducted persons were released some days later after a ransom was reportedly paid.  Related News   Ayade imposes curfew on two communities in Cross River  Cross River street sweepers and shame of a state  France's Macron faces Labour Day protests   
In the meantime, the state government has decided to establish a security outfit to complement the efforts of the existing security agencies in the state.
Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River said that the establishment of the security outfit was part of his administration’s proactive approach, aimed at ensuring peace and security in the state.
The governor gave the assurance he received the Consul-General of France in Nigeria, Amb. Laurent Polonceaux, and his entourage in his private residence in Calabar.
He said that the operations of the outfit, the Homeland Security Service, which would not be armed, would be a complete departure from the traditional methods of policing.
Ayade said the Homeland Security was also expected to provide about 3,000 jobs for the citizens of the state.        
He said that the duties of the outfit would involve intelligence gathering and profiling of persons coming into the state and going out of the state, among others.
He, however, solicited the technical and logistics support of the government of France for the security organisation.
Responding, Polonceaux thanked the governor for the meeting and solicited healthy, robust relations between his country and Cross River.

gunmen suspected to be kidnappers on Sunday abducted Mrs. Cynthia Diden, one of the wives of the member representing Warri-North state constituency in the Delta State House of Assembly, Mr. Michael Diden, popularly known as Ejele.
Ejele is a close ally of  the state Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa.
The suspected kidnappers, who had contacted the family, reportedly demanded N200m as ransom before she would be released. 
Associates of the lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told our correspondent on Wednesday that she was kidnapped around 7pm on Sunday at the Effurun Roundabout in the Uvwie Local Government Area of the state.
It was gathered that the victim was returning home from work when the incident occurred.
Findings by PUNCH Metro revealed that she was kidnapped by fierce-looking gunmen numbering five, who had trailed her to the spot.      
A family source, who confirmed the incident, said her husband decided to keep the kidnap from the public following the abductors’ warning.
Another member of the family revealed that the lawmaker, a notable youth leader in the Niger Delta region, had been having a running battle with some youths in the state.
The source said, “The kidnappers contacted Ejele and demanded a ransom of N500m which was later reduced to N200m after negotiations on Tuesday.”
Our correspondent gathered that Ejele’s eldest wife, Mary, who is the Special Adviser on Women Mobilisation to Okowa, had been kidnapped in 2009.
She was said to have been released after some days in the kidnappers’ den.

Ezekobe said the ship, a merchant tanker, was used for crude oil operations and the navy was working with Interpol and Nigeria’s secret police to secure the crew’s release. 
Turkey’s Deniz News Agency said the ship, the M/T Puli, was owned by Kaptanoglu Shipping.
Both the kidnapped crew and those who remained on the ship, were “in good health”, the company was reported as saying.
It was unclear how many crew members were aboard, which was carrying chemicals, when it was attacked. Company officials said they have had no contact with the pirates.      
Dirk Steffen, director of maritime security at the Denmark-based Risk Intelligence firm, said the vessel was en route from Port Gentil in Gabon to the Ivory Coast capital, Abidjan, at the time of the attack.
“The attackers had possibly already attempted to board another ship in the vicinity the previous day,”
“It is extremely busy outside the Niger Delta at the moment and we had three attacks against tankers before this one between April 7 and 10,”  he said in an email."

Meanwhile, the troops of the 93 Battalion of the Nigerian Army have arrested six persons in connection with the ethno-religious crisis in Ibi Local Government Area of Taraba State on March 25, 2016.
The Commanding Officer of the Battalion, Lt. Col. C. O. Egemole, said in a statement on Sunday that the troops also recovered some arms and ammunition and other weapons in the area.
He said that the arrested persons and the recovered weapons would be handed over to the police for further investigation and prosecution.
Egemole said that the security forces were intensifying efforts to apprehend other perpetrators of the violence in the area.
He said, “Six persons have so far been arrested in connection with the crisis and the ongoing manhunt for other perpetuators.
 ‘Three Ak47 assault rifles, two AK47 magazines, four single-barrel guns, 11 cartridges, one axe, two hammers, one cutlass, two handsaws, one knife, three mobile phones, one catapult, one broken butt, 19 rounds  of 5.56mm, 104 rounds of 7.2mm special and one litre of PMS have so far been recovered.      
“We will be handing over the suspects and arms to the Nigeria Police Force for further investigation.”
Egemole said that the Army formation held two meetings with the warring factions before the crisis, which were ignored as shown by the disturbance of March 25, 2016.
He explained that the crisis started when some youths stoned worshippers during the Juma’at Service on March 25, 2016.
He said that the security operatives who responded swiftly to the crisis were able to restore law and order within 24 hours.
Egemole, who said that no life was lost during the crisis, added that measures had been put in place to resolve the crisis in the area.
He called on stakeholders to educate the youth of the area on peaceful coexistence.

10th July 2017,Retired police officer abducted after completing gratuity process,"Samson Folarin
 The family of a retired Assistant Superintendent of Police, Sunday Anyasi, have demanded explanations from the National Pension Commission for the sudden disappearance of the victim.
PUNCH Metro learnt that 58-year-old Sunday, who was ill, was called on the telephone by a woman living in the same Idumu-Ogo community, Delta State, with him, informing him that his gratuity was ready.
He was said to have gone to Abuja, where he was asked to fill some forms to enable the commission to complete the processing of the payment. 
Our correspondent was told that the victim, who went on the journey with his younger brother, Emmanuel, had been assured that he would receive an alert from his bank soon.
However, Sunday was reportedly abducted near Idumuje-Ugboko, in the Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State, while the brother, Emmanuel, escaped.
It was learnt that efforts by the family to get the Divisional Police Officer, Issele-Uku Police Station, Greg Oshike, to investigate the abduction were abortive, as the police boss allegedly insisted on payment “for logistics.”      
A relative of the victim, Peter Anyasi, who spoke for the family, said they suspected that the kidnap was over the gratuity, adding that the circumstances surrounding the incident and the DPO’s refusal to investigate it were sufficient proof.
He said, “My brother, Sunday, was abducted by unidentified armed men on May 31, 2017, while travelling with other passengers from Abuja to Issele-Uku, Aniocha North LGA of Delta State.
“He had been fighting ill health since his retirement from active service and had requested his younger brother, Emmanuel, to accompany him as a guide on the ill-fated trip.
“They were together at the time of the abduction near Idumuje-Ugboko.
“Emmanuel, who sat close to the door of the bus, managed to escape. Some members of the gang pursued Emmanuel, while others guarded the hijacked bus and its occupants. The pursuers gave up on chasing him and later returned to the rest of the gang.”
He noted that prior to the journey, Sunday had received a telephone call from one Nkechi Nmakwe, a housewife based in Idumu-Ogo.
He added that the woman informed Sunday that his gratuity was ready and gave him the contact of one Linda, a worker with the National Pension Commission, Abuja.        
“Linda in turn gave Sunday the phone number of one Abubakar, who was said to be living in Warri, Delta State, but was claimed to be influential at the pension commission, Abuja.
“He was advised by his self-acclaimed benefactors to keep the information about his proposed trip to himself. He was also advised to travel first to Warri to meet Abubakar, who would give him all the necessary assistance with the payment of his service benefits at the pension commission, Abuja.
“Thereafter, Sunday Anyasi left his home for Warri in search of Abubakar. He only disclosed his mission to Emmanuel, who accompanied him on the journey.
“When they could not reach Abubakar on his telephone lines, they returned to Idumu-Ogo and contacted Linda. Linda then advised them to come directly to her at Abuja.
“At the National Pension Commission, Abuja, Linda led the Anyasi brothers to one of the offices where Sunday was given some forms regarding the proposed payment of his service benefits to complete. After duly completing the forms, he was assured that before long, he would receive an alert from his bank about the payment of his benefits,” Peter said.
The victim was returning when he was abducted and his whereabouts had remained unknown.
PUNCH Metro learnt that when Nmakwe was challenged over the incident, she initially denied linking Sunday with anyone, but recanted after some pressure.      
She reportedly claimed that the person whom she asked to help Sunday with the gratuity payment was based in Enugu, and not Abuja.  Related News   Former minister Graham-Douglas dies at 82  Rainstorm uproots trees, destroys cars in Lagos  Nigeria's Statistician-General dies eight months after appointment   
The victm’s younger brother, Emmanuel, was said to have reported the case at the Issele-Uku Police Station.
The family alleged that the station DPO demanded money from the family.
 Peter said, “The DPO of Usele-Uku division said the family would be responsible for the accommodation and feeding of the travelling police officers during investigation. He refused to state clearly the exact amount of this so-called logistics.
“Though I strongly believe that the burden of the cost of the investigation of a crime should not be borne by the victim’s family, I was, however, willing to meet the demands of Mr. Oshike halfway. The only problem was that he continued to quibble about how much he was willing to be paid for the so-called logistics of police investigation.”
The Investigating Police Officer was also alleged to have said everyone in the station had been instructed not to do anything on the case.
After the family became frustrated, they were said to have gone to Abuja, accompanied by one Cyril Okeleke, a relative who was also a retired police officer.  
Together with the victim’s only son, Victor, the family got to the pension office on June 12, 2017.
The PENCOM authorities were alleged to have threatened to arrest Okeleke for coming to make an enquiry about a missing person without a lawyer.
They were said to have later assured the family that Sunday’s gratuity would not be paid to the wrong person as it would not be ready until after one year.
Peter said, “If so, why then was Sunday given the invitation to Abuja? On whose authority did Linda invite him to Abuja and why was the victim told that he would soon receive an alert from his bank?  Why was it necessary for Sunday, who had served the police for 35 years outside Abuja, to be invited to Abuja for the payment of the second part of his service benefits after he had been paid the first part in Lagos, the last location of his service?”
 When contacted, the Issele-Uku Divisional Police Officer, Oshike, said the matter had already been taken over by the state command.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Andrew Aniamaka, described Oshike as an excellent officer who could not be involved in any unethical practice.
He said, “The DPO you spoke about cannot be asking the family of a colleague, even though retired (to bring money). He is an excellent officer. If Sunday Anyasi is missing, we feel the pain of the family. All we need is encouragement to look for him so that we can have a good story to tell. The command is doing everything possible to ensure that he is found unhurt.”      
 The Head of Media, PENCOM, Mr. Emeka Onuora, denied the involvement of the commission, adding that the retired police officer might have fallen into the hands of fraudsters.
He said, “Under the 2004 PENCOM Act, it is assumed that all those who worked for the Federal Government from whatever year to 2004, have been retired, even if some of them still have some years in service.
“If they continue to work, a year to the time of their final retirement, they will fill an enrolment form, which is not filled in PENCOM office in Abuja. We have offices in the six geo-political zones of the country and our officers are out there. The purpose of filling this form is to enable the Federal Government to know how much it owed this set of workers. The money is then added to the savings account they opened with the Pension Fund Administrator (PFA).
“The PFA handles all issues of payment and deals directly with the pensioners. Everything that has to do with gratuity is supposed to be handled by the PFAs. PENCOM has nothing to do with this case because we are only a regulator. He might have fallen into the hands of fraudsters.”
Both Nmakwe and Linda’s telephone numbers were switched off when our correspondent attempting reaching them for comments on Sunday.

7th July 2017,Lagos traditional ruler abducted over leadership tussle,"Afeez Hanafi
The family of Chief Yusuf Ogundare, the Baale of Sangisha, Magodo, Lagos State, has said his abduction is connected with the rivalry between him and another traditional ruler in the community, Oba Jamiu Lawal.
Lawal, however, refuted the allegation, saying he had no hands in the kidnap of the 46-year-old, which occurred on Wednesday.
It was learnt that the baale was in his car going to visit a community leader, identified as Baba Ade Iga, in company with his younger brother when he received a call. 
The caller was said to have asked him to come to a restaurant at the CMD area to discuss a land transaction, which made him to take a detour and head for the restaurant.
The brother, who did not want his name in print, told PUNCH Metro that they met with three men in the restaurant and the suspects requested that he (brother) should be excused from the meeting.
He said the baale granted the request and after a brief discussion, they asked to be led to Magodo, where the piece of land was.      
The brother said, “They asked us to leave our car and join them in a Toyota Venza they brought. Baale sat at the back between the two of them, while I sat in the front. We were about to leave, when I saw a pump-action gun beside the driver.
“I raised the alarm and struggled for the steering with him. He parked and pushed me out of the car. They linked Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and zoomed off. I don’t know them, but I can recognise them. The incident happened around 11.15am.”
The victim’s wife, Adebisi Ogundare, alleged that his life had been under threat since Lawal was installed as a traditional ruler of the community a few months ago.
Adebisi stated that the abductors had yet to establish contact with the family, urging the police to go after the mastermind of the incident.
She said, “My husband is the only paramount ruler recognised in the community. But sometime in April, Jamiu Lawal declared himself the ruler. The last time we were in court, somebody from his camp said my husband would soon be abducted. We reported at the Lagos State Police Command and zone 2. They said investigation was ongoing.”
However, Lawal denied  his alleged involvement in Yusuf’s abduction, adding that he had several court rulings that pronounced him as the ruler of the community
He said, “I don’t know anything about his abduction. Both of us were invited for a meeting to resolve the issues in Alausa, Ikeja. The meeting was slated for 4pm yesterday (Wednesday).        
“I have been crowned and given a certificate by the government. The matter went through a tribunal and a high court and I won. We were invited by the police from zone 2 and I tendered all the documents. I have no hands in his abduction.”
The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Olarinde Famous-Cole, in a statement said investigations had commenced.
The statement read in part, “On July 5, 2017, at about 1.30pm, one Mohammed Adams  reported to the police that at about 12pm of the same date, he accompanied his brother, named Yusuf Ogundare, the Baale of Shangisha, to CMD Guest House, Shangisha, after he was invited on the telephone by some men who wanted to buy a piece of land.
“He stated further that while taking the men to Shangisha inside the buyer’s Toyota Venza for the inspection of the land, they discovered that three of the men were armed.
“On getting to Domino’s Pizza Junction, along the CMD Road, Shangisha, the brother was left by the roadside, while his brother was taken away to an unknown destination. Effort to reach him on the telephone proved abortive.
“Reporting the incident, he suspected one Jamiu Lawal of Lawal Street, Oregun, and Saliu Akanni, as the masterminds of the act due to the long feud and protracted dispute between the suspects and the Baale of Shangisha on baale’s title.
“Effort is being made to arrest those mentioned, while the tracking of other hoodlums has been initiated.”

She was said to have been kidnapped alongside her children and a male co-tenant but the hoodlums later freed the other victims.

Gunmen, suspected to be kidnappers, have abducted Mrs. Edith Moron, the wife of the Principal of Gbanrainowei Grammar School, Okolobiri, Bayelsa State, Mr. Moron Pereowei.
The incident occurred about 2.03am on Friday in their residence at Azikoro Village, Yenagoa Local Government Area of the state.
The hoodlums said to be 12 in number, reportedly gained access into the house of the school principal after breaking in through a window. 
The window they smashed to get entry into the house is said to be the window of a room of Edith’s younger brother.
It was learnt that after ripping the window open, the hoodlums reportedly pointed gun at Edith’s brother, whom they used to make the principal and his wife to come out of the bedroom.
It was further learnt that when the Principal and his wife came out, their attackers shot at the house repeatedly to make them realise that they were dead serious with the operation.      
It was gathered that the kidnappers’ target was the Principal’s wife hence they shot her in the leg before whisking her away.
A close family source, who wished not to be named, said the gunmen were 12, stressing that while two went inside for the operation, 10 persons mounted guards on the premises and outside the residence.
The source, who is a secondary school teacher, said the kidnappers allegedly ransacked the house, stole some money and other valuables before taking away their victim to an unknown destination.

They used his wife’s brother to make them come out. At a gun point, they (husband and wife) opened their doors and gate and came out.
”The bullet fired at the house touched the wife on the leg. They took the wife and left the husband. About 12 of them came for the operation. Ten persons were outside, while two were in the house.”

The source, who said the matter had been reported to police, noted that the victim was in her 40s and hailed from Sampou in Kolokuma/Opokuma LGA of the state.
Efforts to get the reaction of the spokesman for the Bayelsa State Police Command, Mr. Asinim Butswat, proved abortive as several calls to his mobile phone did not connect.
But a senior police officer, who craved anonymity, because he was not authorised to speak on the matter, confirmed the abduction.
He said the kidnappers’ target was the Principal’s wife (Edith), noting that as soon as they succeeded in abducting the woman, they left.
”They came around 2.03am on Friday. The husband of the woman was around but the abductors decided to take the wife. They stole some money and valuable items from the house before they vamoosed,” the police source said."

26th May 2017,Gunmen abduct six Lagos pupils three days after writing school,"Afeez Hanafi
Gunmen took advantage of security lapses around creeks in Igbonla, Epe, on Thursday to abduct six pupils of Igbonla Model College, Epe, Lagos.
This came seven months after four pupils and two members of staff of the college were kidnapped in October 2016.
READ: Gunmen attack community, abduct landlord, teenager 
It was learnt that the gunmen gained entry into the school premises around 6am on Thursday through the creek at the back of the college.
They were said to have pulled down the school fence and headed for the boys’ hostel, seizing 10 Senior Secondary School pupils.
Our correspondent was told that four of the pupils were later released at the waterside by the assailants after profiling their parents’ details.      
They escaped with the remaining six pupils, identified as Peter Jonah, Isiaq Rahmon, Adebayo George, Judah Agbausi, Pelumi Philips and Farouq Yusuf.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the gunmen had shot into the air around 8pm on Wednesday while the pupils were having a prep, but went back after policemen and soldiers fired back.
They struck after the operatives had left the school in the dawn.
A Senior Secondary School 2 pupil, who gave his name only as Daniel, said he was having his bath when the gunmen stormed the premises.
He said, “A friend saw two of them through the window and rushed to tell me that kidnappers had come again. Immediately we raised the alarm, they entered into our hostel, broke the doors and started dragged some pupils out. I hid in the bathroom.”

Another pupil, who did not want his name in print, said, the gunmen took their time to carry out the operation.        
“Two of them broke down our doors and told us to lie down. They didn’t use masks and one of them wore a police uniform. They asked if we had phones, but we said no. After picking some pupils, they packed some of our belongings, including sandals. Isiaq (Rahmon) resisted following them until they slapped him.
“While we were doing our homeworks on Wednesday, they shot into the air, but our teachers told us not to panic. They left because policemen and military men were on the ground,” he added.
A Junior Secondary School 2 pupil, who was ill and admitted to the school’s sickbay said, “When they came, they were shooting. I jumped from my sickbed and hid under the bed. Everybody was scared.”
Our correspondent observed as parents thronged the school to pick their children, ignoring the school authorities’ assurance that the pupils were safe.
Some parents of the abducted pupils were inconsolable as they broke down in tears.

One of them, Maruf Rahmon, said he was at work when his wife, Ikamat, called him that Isiaq had been abducted.
He said, “I have three children here; Isiaq is one of them. The school authorities had a meeting with us this afternoon (Thursday). We were told at the meeting that the kidnappers had written the school three days ago that they were coming. But they didn’t inform parents. I would have come to pick my children.”

Another affected parent, Isiaq Yusuf, said, “I am sad. Faruq (Yusuf) is in SSS1. I want to see my son. The school authorities are telling us to be patient, but a child is not a goat.”
Mrs. Riskat Odunukan, whose child, Jubril ­– a SSS1 pupil – was freed by the kidnapper, decried the poor security in the college.
She lamented that the school had not implemented any of the security measures recommended by parents after the October 2016 incident.
Riskat said, “ There should be total demolition and reconstruction of the fence and it should be high. Bushes in the school’s surroundings should be cleared and there should be a police post around the creeks with Armoured Personnel Carriers.
“Jubril said those kidnappers asked him about his parents’ details and he told them that his father was late. He said they also asked if he knew my phone number, but he said no and they asked him to go.  
“The school did not call us; we read the news on the parents’ platform. I thought I was daydreaming. I called some teachers to confirm, but their lines did not go through.
“When the last year incident happened, we advised the school to mount Closed Circuit  Television Cameras and clear the bushes. Nothing has been done. The so called tricycles they bought for the school security men are not being used to patrol the surroundings. The kidnappers capitalised on those lapses.”
Our correspondent gathered that a child, who told the kidnappers that his father was a pilot, was among those taken away.
“The kidnappers came when military men guarding the school had gone. They took 10 pupils, but released four after profiling them. I think they took away those whose parents are rich,” another parent, Alhaja Amirat Alamorieda, said.
A driver and resident of the community, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the abdutors had been on the waterways since Monday.
The school authorities, including the permanent secretary in the state’s Ministry of Education, declined comments on the incident when approached by our correspondent.
However, the member of the House of Assembly representing Epe Constituency II, Mr. Segun Olulade, said the government would ensure the release of the pupils, adding that the school would be shut till Monday.      
“The government is making efforts in terms of security. The incident is unfortunate. Parents who want to take their children home are allowed because of their emotional state. There is a mid-term break on Thursday and Friday. So, the school will resume by Monday,” he added.

10th February 2017,"Gunmen operate for five hours, kill three guards, abduct resident","Afeez Hanafi
Twenty six days after a gang abducted pupils and staff members of the Nigerian Turkish International Colleges, gunmen said to be members of the gang stormed Isheri North Estate, Lagos State, on Thursday, seizing the secretary of the estate’s residents association, Mr. Dayo Adekoya.
Three of the estate security guards, identified simply as Dugbe, Oluyole and Friday aka Fayo, were shot dead by the assailants while two other guards sustained gunshot injuries.
PUNCH Metro learnt that the kidnappers had at about 7pm announced their presence on the waterway around the estate with some shots before they invaded the estate at about 12.30am. 
As the gunmen headed for Adekoya’s house, the guards reportedly chased them.
“But unknown to them, some of the kidnappers had laid in ambush near the secretary’s house. They opened fire on the guards and three of them died instantly while two were injured,” a resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.
Our correspondent gathered that one of the kidnappers scaled the fence into Adekoya’s premises and opened the gate for his accomplices.      
“They cut through the burglar-proof bars and shattered the window glasses to enter his room. They took him away shooting indiscriminately,” the resident added.
PUNCH Metro observed the fingerprints suspected to be those of the kidnappers on wall, while their footprints could be seen on the path leading to the waterway, through which they escaped.
On the premises, our correspondent heard a relative of the victim telling somebody on the telephone that the kidnappers had contacted Adekoya’s wife.
“They have called his wife; they are demanding N80m ransom,” the relative said.
The man, who did not identify himself, however, declined further comment when he was approached.
Distraught Adekoya’s wife said, “I am not speaking with the press now. His life is precious to us. I can grant interview after his release.”
A member of the estate’s executive lamented spate of kidnapping on the estate, stating that poor infrastructure made it to be vulnerable to attacks.        
He said, “The roads here are bad; there is no government’s presence in this estate. We pay land use charges, but provide security for ourselves. There are nine zones on this estate. Each zone has three security guards and they are provided with walkie-talkies and motorcycles.
“We were awake when the kidnappers struck and the security guards tried to pursue them. Unfortunately, they (the kidnappers) shot three guards dead.”
A security guard, who did not want his name in print, said the three deceased resumed work last week.  Related News   Three arrested for killing Philippine governor  Police nab suspected criminal tricycle operator  FG lists crimes prevalent in N’West, S’South, others   
The guard, who spoke in Yoruba, said, “Around 7.30pm on Wednesday, I heard gunshots and in my observation, the shootings were from the waterside. They would pause for some minutes and shoot again. We were all vigilant.
“A few minutes after 12am, they came into the estate through the creeks. We went after them and three of our men were shot dead in the process, while two are in a hospital.”
The estate chairman, Mr. Remi Osijo, in a statement, commiserated with the families of the deceased and wished the kidnap victim a safe return.
Osijo said the incident devastated residents, adding that the estate’s executive had started discussions with security operatives to find a lasting solution to the crisis.      
“At about 12.30am on Thursday, February 9, 2017, a group of armed men numbering about 11 stormed a home on our estate. They laid siege to the house for about one hour trying to gain entrance.
“Our security team that responded swiftly to distress calls from occupants put up a gallant fight, but succumbed to the superior firepower of the assailants. Three of our security men lost their lives. A resident, Mr. Dayo Adekoya, was kidnapped,” the statement read in part.
Operatives of the Lagos State Police Command, led by the Commissioner of Police, Fatai Owoseni, the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team and soldiers from the 81 Division, Ikeja, visited the landlord’s house and the waterside.
Owoseni stated that the kidnappers had wanted to abduct another resident, but were prevented by the police, adding that efforts were ongoing to rescue Adekoya.
“This estate is porous and vulnerable. We are here to do a thorough assessment of the estate and see how we can work with the households in relation to policing an estate of this nature to ensure that we don’t have a recurrence,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has directed the state police command to ensure the arrest of the kidnappers.
The governor, in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Steve Ayorinde, also assured residents of the government’s commitment to safety of lives and property.  
“While the state government commiserates with the families of the three dead estate security guards, it will leave no stone unturned to ensure that lives and property of residents in the state are protected.
“Last week, the governor had demonstrated his determination to eradicate the menace of kidnapping when he signed into law the anti-kidnapping bill recently passed by the state House of Assembly.
“The law imposes a penalty of life imprisonment on kidnapping for ransom and death penalty in the event of death of a kidnapped victim,” the statement read in part.

9th February 2017,"How Pirates abducted Russians, Ukrainian","Rasheed Bisiriyu 
Three Russians and one Ukrainian have been kidnapped by pirates after attacking a cargo ship off the coast of Nigeria.
The Russian embassy, which broke the news on its official Twitter account, had requested the Nigerian authorities to assist in locating the abducted people, Reuters said in a report on Wednesday.
It said the general cargo vessel, whose name was given as BBC Caribbean, was managed by Briese Schiffahrts. 
“The armed pirates approached (the vessel) in a boat, captured the crew (members) and left on the boat at the direction of the Nigerian shores,” the Director of a Briese Schiffahrts subsidiary in St. Petersburg,” Pavel Fedulov, said.
The original report credited to Russian news organisation, RBC, also reported the director as saying no firearms were used during the attack.
According to security experts, West Africa’s waters, especially off Nigeria where most of the pirates originate, are some of the world’s most dangerous, with attackers often targeting oil tankers as well as taking hostages to ransom.        Related News   Police rescue 28 kidnapped Akwa Ibom fishermen  Navy debunks pirates' invasion of Akwa Ibom beach  Navy deploys two helicopters, 10 gunships against pirates   
It noted that pirate gangs had taken to abducting crew members for ransom as a way to make more money following the drop in oil prices.
The pirates have emerged from militant groups in the Niger Delta, according to security analysts.
Also, the Nigerian Navy on Wednesday said its officers rescued an oil tanker, the MT Gaz Providence, and its 21 crew members from a separate pirate attack near Bonny Island.
The navy said in a statement that another attack was also fended off by the navy south of Akassa in Delta State, where pirates had twice reportedly tried to hijack the oil tanker, MT Rio Spirit.

Gunmen on Sunday abducted a female lecturer, Leeyira Sinee, on her way to a church in Bori, Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State.
It was gathered that Sinee lectures in the Department of Computer Science, Kenule Sara-Wiwa Polytechnic, also located in the area.
The gunmen were said to be masked, even as a source disclosed that the operation of the hoodlums, which was carried out at about 8am with precision, did not last up to a minute. 
Chairman of Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics, Kenule Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic, Ferry Gberegbe, confirmed the incident, maintaining that the lecturer was whisked away on Sunday while she was going to church.
Gberegbe, however, pleaded with Sinee’s abductors to release her unconditionally, describing her as an easy-going woman that would never harm anybody.
He explained that relatives and well-wishers of the victims had yet to establish contact with her abductor after the incident.      
He said, “The young lady was accosted this (Sunday) morning by men of the underworld while going to church. We are yet to get calls from the kidnappers. She has not been released.
“We are appealing to the kidnappers to release her unconditionally. As a result of this, we are calling on the governor of the state to do something because the issue of kidnapping in Bori is becoming unbearable.
“We are calling on him (governor) to do everything possible to restore peace in Bori, which is the traditional headquarters of Ogoni. All we are saying is that relevant security agencies should swing into action to bring about her safe release. She has not done harm to anybody.”
Efforts made by our correspondent to reach the state Police Public Relations Officer to speak on the incident was unsuccessful as several calls to his phone was not answered while a text message to him was also not replied.

Tragedy struck in Fagbile Phase 3 Estate, White Sand, in the Ijegun area of Lagos State after some gunmen killed two residents and abducted a teenager, Uloma Igwe.
Those killed were identified as the Chairman of the Harmony Community Development Association, Malam Ibrahim Omatar, and a Togolese, identified simply as Job.
PUNCH Metro gathered that Omatar was returning from work when a landlord called him on the telephone, saying he was being attacked by suspected robbers. 
The 47-year-old reportedly raised the alarm in order to mobilise the local vigilance group and alert other residents.
The gunmen were said to have shot him in the head and chest, killing him on the spot.
Job, a block molder, was reportedly killed some distance away.      
A resident, who did not want to be identified for security reason, said the 8pm Tuesday attack was not up to 15 minutes.
He said, “I didn’t see the gunmen; what caught our attention were the reports as they gunned down the chairman and the block molder.
“I think the chairman spotted them as they were leaving with Uloma (Igwe). As he raised the alarm, they shot him in the chest and head.
“The block molder was killed some distance away. He was unlucky to have run into them and was killed.”
A relative of Igwe, who did not want to be identified, said she was kidnapped while heading home from work.
He explained that during what appeared to be a struggle between the 18-year-old and the assailants, her phone, foot wears and wristwatch fell off.
He said the items were later picked up by the family during a search for her.        
“The kidnappers called us yesterday (Wednesday). They said we must pay them N1.5m before they will release her. I told them that we didn’t have the money.
“They threatened that if I didn’t get the money they would come for me; I told them that the family was struggling to raise it and they should be patient.
“They allowed me to speak with her and she told me she was doing well. She, however, said she could not tell the location of the place where they took her to,” the relative added.

19th December 2016,"Gunmen abduct Catholic priest, demand N20m","Ovie Okpare, Warri
The gunmen who abducted a Catholic Priest in Delta on Friday last week have demanded N20m as ransom.
Fr. Jude Onyebadi, the Parish Priest of SS Peter and Paul Catholic Church, Issele-Azagba, was allegedly abducted by three gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen at his pineapple farm located between Ubulu-Uku and Issele-Uku communities.
Sources close to the priest told our correspondent on Monday that the captors had established contact with church and made their demands known even as the police command in the state claimed its personnel were closing in on the suspects. 
Eyewitnesses said the hoodlums stormed the farm command-style and immediately went for the cleric, and dragged him into the bush and whisked him away to unknown destination.
One of the sources said, “Father was kidnapped by three armed men who were dressed and looked like Fulani herdsmen. Before help could come he had already been dragged into the bush from where we have not heard from him till today (Monday). They ignored his sports utility vehicle at the farm during the operation that lasted few minutes.”
It was gathered that the captors initially demanded N50m.      
The Director of Communications of the Diocese, Rev. Fr. Charles Uganwa, confirmed the incident and appealed to the abductors to release his colleague unconditionally.
The Spokesman of the Delta State Police Command, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, while confirming the abduction of the priest gave the assurance that cleric would soon be freed.
He said, “We are combing the bushes and very soon, he will be freed. I can assure you that we are monitoring the kidnappers who keep shifting from one location to the other, but no matter how they may try to hide, we will get them.”
Fr. Onyebadi owns one of the biggest commercial pineapple farms in the state – where he trains people and awards scholarship to students."
