        "#text = \"\"\"The purpose of our study was to learn the distribution characteristics of cancer stem cell markers (CD24, CD44) in invasive carcinomas with different grade and molecular subtype. For research was used 1324 postoperative breast cancer samples, from which were selected 393 patient with invasive ductal carcinoma samples examined 2008-2012 in Laboratory of \"Pathgeo Union of Pathologist\" is and N.Kipshidze Central University Hospital. The age range is between 23-73 year. For all cases were performed immunohistochemical study using ER, PR, Her2, Ki67, CK5- molecular markers (Leica Microsystems). For identify cancer stem cells mononuclear antibodies CD24 (BIOCARE MEDICAL, CD44 - Clone 156-3C11; CD24 - Clone SN3b) were used. Association of CD44/CD24 expression in different subtypes of cells, between clinicopathological parameters and different biological characteristics were performed by Pearson correlation and usind X2 tests. Obtained quantitative statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS V.19.0 program. Statistically significant were considered 95% of confidence interval. The data shows, that towards G1-G3, amount of CD44 positive cases increased twice. CD44 positive cases are evenly distributed between Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2+, triple negative basal like cell subtypes and in significantly less (4,8 times) in Her2+ cases. Maximum amount of CD44 negative cases is shown in Luminal A subtype, which could be possible cause of better prognosis and high sensitivity for chemotherapy. For one's part such aggressive subtypes of breast cancer as Luminal B and basal like cell type, are characterized by CD44 positive and antigen high expression, which can be reason of aggressive nature of this types and also reason of chemotherapy resistance. As well as amount of CD24 positive cases according to malignancy degree, also antigen expression features does not show any type of correlation between malignancy degree and CD24 positivity or with CD24 expression features, or presence of stem cells. That can be the reason of tumor aggressivity and chemoresistance. exceptions are Her2 positive tumors because they have different base of carcinogenesis.\"\"\"\n",
