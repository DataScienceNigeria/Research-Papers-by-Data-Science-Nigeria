#  AI-POWERED UNDERSTANDING OF FAMILY PLANNING BEHAVIOURAL CHANGE USING THE FOGG MODEL ([Paper](https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2022/pdf/PML4DC_ICLR2022_7.pdf))

## Abstract
In this work, we share our methodology and findings from applying named entity recognition (NER) using machine learning, to identify behavioural patterns in
transcribed family planning client call centre data in Nigeria based on the Foggâ€™s
model. The Fogg Behaviour Model (FBM) describes the interaction of three key
elements Motivation (M), Ability (A), and a Prompt (P) and their interaction to
produce behavioural change. This work is part of a larger project that is focused
on practical application of artificial intelligence to analyse and derive insight from
large scale data call centre data. The entity recognition model called Fogg Model
Entity Recognition(FMER) was trained using spaCy, an open source software library for advanced natural language processing on a total of 11510 words and F1
score of 98.5
