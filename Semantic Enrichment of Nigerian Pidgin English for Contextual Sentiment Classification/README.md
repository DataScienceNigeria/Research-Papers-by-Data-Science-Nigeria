# Semantic Enrichment of Nigerian Pidgin English for Contextual Sentiment Classification ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12450.pdf))
This research explores how to understand sentiments in Nigerian Pidgin. 
This work presents a 300 VADER lexicon compatible Nigerian Pidgin sentiment tokens and their scores and a 14,000 gold standard Nigerian Pidgin tweets and their sentiments labels.
The result shows that the quality of sentiment labels generated by our updated VADER lexicon is better compared to the labels generated by the original VADER English lexicon.
 
The `English_VADER_Lexicon_Update.ipynb` contains the code implentation on how to update the English VADER lexicon with the Nigerian Pidgin.
The `data` folder contains the sample datasets. Or alternatively, here is the [link](https://git.io/JvHrp) to the Nigerian Pidgin Tweets and Sentiments, and the [link](https://git.io/Jv9og) to the 300 Nigerian Pidgin Sentiments and Scores.

## Running the experiments
The code can be ran using the publicly available [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) kernel. 
Alternatively, you can open the `.ipynb` files using [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html). 
#### You will need the following dependencies to run the code
- Vadersentiment - can be installed by running the following command in Colab:
```
!pip install vadersentiment
```
Or install it directly to your computer if you're using a jupyter notebook
