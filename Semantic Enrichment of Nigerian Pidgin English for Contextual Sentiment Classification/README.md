# Semantic Enrichment of Nigerian Pidgin English for Contextual Sentiment Classification
This research explores how to understand sentiments in Nigerian Pidgin. 
This work presents a 300 VADER lexicon compatible Nigerian Pidgin sentiment tokens and their scores and a 14,000 gold standard Nigerian Pidgin tweets and their sentiments labels.
The result shows that the quality of sentiment labels generated by our updated VADER lexicon is better compared to the labels generated by the original VADER English lexicon.
 
The `How_to_update_English_VADER_Lexicon_with_Nigerian_Pidgin_Sentiments.ipynb` contains the code implentation on how to update the English VADER lexicon with the Nigerian Pidgin.
The `data` folder contains the sample datasets.
