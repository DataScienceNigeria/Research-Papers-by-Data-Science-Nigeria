# A Comparative Analysis of Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Classification for Labeling Tweets about Police Brutality ([Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356800555_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Semi-Supervised_and_Self-Supervised_Classification_for_Labeling_Tweets_about_Police_Brutality#fullTextFileContent))

Social media has proven to be influential in social justice advocacy. In 2020, thousands of Nigerians and allies used the EndSARS hashtag to protest police brutality in Nigeria.  In this work, we aim to understand the conversation associated with the EndSARS hashtag by comparing the outcome of semi-supervised and self-supervised machine learning classification algorithms for the automatic labeling of tweets. The self-supervised, zero-shot learning algorithm had the best performance for automatic tweet labeling with  average weighted recall of 0.73, compared to cosine similarity with TF-IDF(0.71), cosine similarity with universal sentence encoder (0.58) and Jaccard Similarity(0.222). The major topics of discussion included complaints about police brutality events, Lekki Massacre, activism, media coverage, lack of response from public figures and questions about moving forward.

The `Sample notebook.ipynb` contains the code implementation comparing Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Classification for Labeling Tweets about EndSARS protest.
