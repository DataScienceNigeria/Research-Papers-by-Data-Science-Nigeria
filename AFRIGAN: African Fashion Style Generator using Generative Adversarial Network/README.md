# AFRIGAN: African Fashion Style Generator using Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) (paper)

## Abstract

Afrocentric fashion  images suitable for machine learning tasks are not well represented in open datasets.In this work we present AFRIGAN, a generative adversarial model for contemporary african fashion images. AFRIGAN can be leveraged as a tool for realistic image data synthesis, design iteration and experimentation for contemporary African fashion styles. This model is openly available [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-H92c9YC6AOWEtAuXnxnF5n3XeQnXf9L).
