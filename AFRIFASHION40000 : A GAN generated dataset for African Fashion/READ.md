# AFRIFASHION40000 : A GAN generated dataset for African Fashion

This Paper is currently under review at the Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems(NeurIPS 2021)

`AFRIFASHION40000` is a GAN generated dataset for African fashion and an improved version of our previous work on AFRIFASHION1600. It contains 40000 samples labelled into 7 classes representing some AFRICAN fashion styles. 



Each sample is coloured and has an  image  size  of  128  x  128.   
This dataset has been curated to ensure visibility, inclusion, and familiarity of African fashion in computer vision tasks.
