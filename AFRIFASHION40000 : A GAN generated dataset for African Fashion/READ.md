# AFRIFASHION40000 : A GAN generated African Fashion dataset for Computer Vision

`AFRIFASHION40000` is a an openly available dataset of African fashion images generated using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).It contains 40000 samples labelled into 8 classes representing some AFRICAN fashion styles.

This work explores practical application of artificial intelligence to contemporary African art for new design,image data synthesis and representation in computer vision tasks

This is a sequel to `AFRIFASHION1600`, a small dataset of contemporary African fashion images. `AFRIFASHION40000` contains 40000 images with a dimension of 128 X 128 for each image in the 7 indentifiable classes.
