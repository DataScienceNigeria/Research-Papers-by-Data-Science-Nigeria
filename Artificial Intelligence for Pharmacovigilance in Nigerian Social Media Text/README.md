# Artificial Intelligence for Pharmacovigilance in Nigerian Social Media Text ([Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351282201_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_FOR_PHARMACOVIGILANCE_IN_NIGERIAN_SOCIAL_MEDIA_TEXT)) 

Under-reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to public health facilities is one of the challenges facing pharmacovigilance in Nigeria. The advent of social media has opened up a new wave of communication where people can openly discuss a range of topics and they can choose to use pseudonyms. This paper proposes a framework that leverages the named entity recognition (NER), one of the fundamental natural language processing methods for information retrieval and extraction, to identify adverse drug reactions and other medical entities in Nigerian social media conversations.
