Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are normally transmitted between animals and people. The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. It was first detected on the 7th of January 2020 in Wuhan, China. 

Some coronaviruses can be transmitted from person-to-person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, for example, in a household or healthcare setting. For this novel coronavirus (COVID-19), while most initial transmission appeared to be zoonotic, person-to-person transmission is the most important common mode of transmission currently.

As young professionals, we are facing hazards and life threatening challenges in effectively reporting and covering the COVID-19 pandemic. Worse still, in an era of “infodemic” posing serious challenges to young individuals, groups and communities receiving and reacting to this misinformation, it becomes essential for young people to engage and learn directly from fellow young people what the realities are and how together we can use media and information literacy to stay safe amidst the abundance of misinformation and disinformation.

📝 A QUESTION PEOPLE OFTEN ASK 📝
How/Why Do People Recover If There's Still No Proven Cure For COVID-19?
____________________
📢 ANSWER :
Most respiratory viruses-- including Corona viruses such as the ones that causes the Common Cold -- are self-limiting, so to say.
What this means is that they have a relatively finite period in the human body before they ""wear themselves out,"" or the immune system contains them, and the sufferer recovers.
Treatment for these viruses is thus mostly aimed at;
1. Relieving symptoms, in order to make the sufferer comfortable.
2. Keeping the infected person alive by supporting organ systems attacked and impaired by the virus.
Most times, treatment is not aimed at curing such viral illnesses, by attacking the virus itself. This is partly because they're self-limiting, and partly because ...",Genuine,Prevention,Broader societal effects

Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are normally transmitted between animals and people. The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. It was first detected on the 7th of January 2020 in Wuhan, China. 

Some coronaviruses can be transmitted from person-to-person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, for example, in a household or healthcare setting. For this novel coronavirus (COVID-19), while most initial transmission appeared to be zoonotic, person-to-person transmission is the most important common mode of transmission currently.

The poor, it seems, fear hunger than the virus.

📝 A QUESTION PEOPLE OFTEN ASK 📝
How/Why Do People Recover If There's Still No Proven Cure For COVID-19?
____________________
📢 ANSWER :
Most respiratory viruses-- including Corona viruses such as the ones that causes the Common Cold are self-limiting, so to say.
What this means is that they have a relatively finite period in the human body before they ""wear themselves out,"" or the immune system contains them, and the sufferer recovers.
Treatment for these viruses is thus mostly aimed at;
1. Relieving symptoms, in order to make the sufferer comfortable.
2. Keeping the infected person alive by supporting organ systems attacked and impaired by the virus.
Most times, treatment is not aimed at curing such viral illnesses, by attacking the virus itself. This is partly because they're self...",Genuine,Victims/infected,Broader societal effects

April 21, 2020
￼NCDC DG received at the Government House in Kano Monday evening
Kano State on Monday registered 23 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, the state ministry of health has said in a late evening tweet.
The state now has 59 officially recorded cases in all as of the time this report was filed.
Meanwhile, worried by the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases coming out Kano, a delegation from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) led by the Director General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, arrived the state capital Monday evening to commence a monitoring process of the way the state has so far handled the spreading COVID-19 cases in the state.

The only means of communication with family and friends is either through a phone call or social media platforms. There is a massive exposure to the screens of digital devices and this exposure is causing many people to experience Digital Eye strain
Symptoms of Digital eye strain are

If you are a state governor in Nigeria and you are not already working round the clock, night and day, you are playing with fire. Red-hot, napalm FIRE!
Here is your reality. Bonny Light (Nigeria’s crude oil) is trading at about $11. This is half the cost of producing the barrel. Even at that price, Nigeria is not able to sell her crude oil. She has tens of millions of barrels of crude oil in scores of vessels cruising the seas, like a gala seller in Lagos traffic, looking for customers. No one is calling, no one is buying. Nigeria is offering a $5 discount per barrel but who will buy when U.S. shale oil is selling for $2 (and no one is buying that either). Nigeria has other bigger challenges because it does not have onshore crude oil storage so she has to put her oil on vessels. In the last week, the cost of renting the vessels doubled to $350,000 per day. Do you see the picture?
Clearly, this has to be the lowest the oil...",False Context,Conspiracy,Perpetuating political conflict and racial discrimination

2. Hunger crises

The poor are afraid of (2)
The rich are pushing the poor to stay at home as they who are rich believe that is what will save the situation and perhaps their ass as well.
The poor are also pushing to survive as they know they may die of hunger and not the virus if they don't take care.
The rich, it appears, fear the virus and not hunger.
The poor, it seems, fear hunger than the virus.
Each is fighting for his survival, only differently.
Let the rich, if they are really serious push that strategic steps be taken to feed all the poor and constantly, not only once but twice at least.

Given what is understood about this new virus, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has advised on the following measures to prevent transmission: ●Physical distancing– i.e. people should keep a minimum distance of 2 metres from one another.
●Handwashing with soap and water should be performed as frequently as possible or using an alcohol-based sanitizer where no water is available.
●If someone is coughing or sneezing, they should cover their cough, using a disposable tissue and discarding in a waste bin and washing their hands or using their bent elbow. ●Normal practices like greeting one another with handshakes or hugging should be avoided.",Genuine,Prevention,Non-compliance with public health

Here is your reality. Bonny Light (Nigeria’s crude oil) is trading at about $11. This is half the cost of producing the barrel. Even at that price, Nigeria is not able to sell her crude oil. She has tens of millions of barrels of crude oil in scores of vessels cruising the seas, like a gala seller in Lagos traffic, looking for customers. No is calling; no one is buying. Nigeria is offering a $5 discount per barrel but who will buy when U.S. shale oil is selling for $2 (and no one is buying that either). Nigeria has other bigger challenges because it does not have onshore crude oil storage so she has to put her oil on vessels. In the last week, the cost of renting the vessels doubled to $350,000 per day. Do you see the picture?
Clearly, this has to be the lowest th...",False Context,Conspiracy,Non-compliance with public health

""Cold water does not boil faster than hot water. *The rate of heating of a liquid depends on the magnitude of the temperature difference between the liquid and its surroundings* (the flame on the stove, for instance). *As a result, cold water will be absorbing heat faster while it is still cold*; once it gets up to the temperature of hot water, the heating rate slows down and from there it takes just as long to bring it to a boil as the water that was hot to begin with. Because it takes cold water some time to reach the temperature of hot water, cold water clearly takes longer to boil than hot water does. *There may be some psychological effect at play; cold water starts boiling sooner than one might expect because of the aforementioned greater heat absorption rate when water is colder.*😊

It is a common myth that persons who have died of a communicable disease should be cremated, but this is not true. As of March 24, there is no evidence of persons having become infected from exposure to the bodies of persons who died from COVID-19.

The WHO further adds any body fluids leaking from orifices in the cadaver must be contained. There is no need to disinfect the body before transfer to the mortuary area.

People who have died from COVID-19 can be buried or cremated. However, WHO also mentioned that those who are constantly in contact with corpses may witness tuberculosis, bloodborne viruses (eg hepatitis B and C and HIV) and gastrointestinal infections.

Workers who routinely handle corpses may, however, risk contracting tuberculosis, bloodborne viruses (eg hepatitis B and C and HIV) and gastrointestinal infections (e.g. cholera, E. coli, hepatitis A, rotavirus diarrhoea, salmonellosis, shigellosis and typhoid/paratyphoid fevers)

3. If you have to eat anything packaged such as biscuits, yoghurt, Ice cream, bottled drinks, etc., please wash the wrapper because you don't know who and how it was handled before getting to you. This is because in the supermarkets people touch things they don't really pick / buy.

Actually we forget that we go out with our phones, touching it here and there after we come home we wash our hands and continue touching our infected corona phones. Pls we can still be infected so therefore we have to clean our phones with the hand sanitizer and soft silk every time we return from outside for our own good.

*Introduction*
After the publication of my last article on the world fighting with the Coronavirus, a number of people requested an article on the impact of the virus and lockdown on businesses in Nigeria. This second article is written to respond to the request of the readers.
*What is a PESTEL Analysis?*
A PESTEL analysis is simply an acronym for describing the strategic management tool used for scanning the operating environment in order to identify key macro (external) factors that influence an organisation or a country. Each letter in the *PESTEL* analytical framework stands for *Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal factors*.
Let us look at the impact of COVID-19 on the political, economic. social, technological, environmental and legal factors in Nigeria.

Why do you think the poor are unwilling to stay at home?
Is it because you think they want to die?
Let's open our understanding and analyze within proper context..
There are two issues now in Africa.
1. Health crises
2. Hunger crises
The rich are afraid of (1)
The poor are afraid of (2)
The rich are pushing the poor to stay at home as they who are rich believe that is what will save the situation and perhaps their ass as well.
The poor are also pushing to survive as they know they may die of hunger and not the virus if they don't take care.
The rich, it appears, fear the virus and not hunger.
The poor, it seems, fear hunger than the virus.
Each is fighting for his survival, only differently.
Let the rich, if they are really serious push that strategic steps be taken to feed all the poor and constantly, not only once but twice at least.
But if they just keep crying stay at home, the poor may take the desperate mantra to mean- *die at home*

1. Isolate yourself from news about the virus. (Everything we need to know, we already know).
2. Don't look out for death toll. It's not a cricket match to know the latest score. Avoid that.
3. Don't look for additional information on the Internet, it would weaken your mental state. 4.Avoid sending fatalistic messages. Some people don't have the same mental strength as you (Instead of helping, you could activate pathologies such as depression).
5. If possible, Look for board games to entertain children, tell stories and future plans. 6. Maintain discipline in the home by washing your hands, putting up a sign or alarm for everyone in the house.
7. Your positive mood will help protect your immune system, while negative thoughts have been shown to depress your immune system and make it weak against viruses.

- If working (especially those working on essential food or health related produces), reduce area of cover (we understand this will reduce feedback)
- Avoid crowded places as much as possible
- Keep high level of personal Hygiene (by washing hands regularly with soap & water OR hand-sanitizer)
- Avoid touching objects, handles, railings, etc (and if you just have to, please use your left hand & tissue). You could get disposable hand-gloves too.

They can even do video calls if you have to show them something in your body.

She has tens of millions of barrels of crude oil in scores of vessels cruising the seas, like a gala seller in Lagos traffic, looking for customers. No one is calling, no one is buying. Nigeria is offering a $5 discount per barrel but who will buy when U.S. shale oil is selling for $2 (and no one is buying that either). Nigeria has other bigger challenges because it does not have onshore crude oil storage so she has to put her oil on vessels. In the last week, the cost of renting the vessels doubled to $350,000 per day. Do you see the picture?

Introduction
In the early months of 2020, the corona virus changed how students are educated all over the world. It gives a glimpse of the future of education focusing on how e-learning could enhance learning experience outside the classroom. The corona virus also known as COVID-19 is spreading at an alarming rate across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, United States and Africa. Although countries have taken swift actions to curtail its spread by imposing lock downs and movement restrictions, the death toll is still on the rise. As at March 2020, the virus has killed over 37,000 people and infected about 780, 000 worldwide.This infectious disease is able to spread from person to person, with infected people experiencing mild to moderate respiratory illness.

By March, the OECD estimated that 421 million students could be affected due to the closures of schools in over 30 countries. Many countries are on...",Genuine,Public announcements,Broader societal effects

1. Isolate yourself from news about the virus. (Everything we need to know, we already know).
2. Don't look out for death toll. It's not a cricket match to know the latest score. Avoid that.
3. Don't look for additional information on the Internet, it would weaken your mental state. 4.Avoid sending fatalistic messages. Some people don't have the same mental strength as you (Instead of helping, you could activate pathologies such as depression).
5. If possible, Look for board games to entertain children, tell stories and future plans. 6. Maintain discipline in the home by washing your hands, putting up a sign or alarm for everyone in the house.
7. Your positive mood will help protect your immune system, while negative thoughts have been shown to depress your immune system and make it weak against viruses.

INTRODUCTION 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The virus comes from Coronaviridae family and is single-stranded RNA, with crown-like shape; thus, its name. 
Most people infected with the COVID-19 experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without special treatment. 
However, older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

EPIDEMIOLOGY:
The disease first occurred in Wuhan, China, due to exposure to wet animal market. Previous outbreaks of coronaviruses (CoVs) include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012.

Why do you think the poor are unwilling to stay at home?
Is it because you think they want to die?
Let's open our understanding and analyze within proper context..
There are two issues now in Africa.
1. Health crises
2. Hunger crises
The rich are afraid of (1)
The poor are afraid of (2)
The rich are pushing the poor to stay at home as they who are rich believe that is what will save the situation and perhaps their ass as well.
The poor are also pushing to survive as they know they may die of hunger and not the virus if they don't take care.
The rich, it appears, fear the virus and not hunger.
The poor, it seems, fear hunger than the virus.
Each is fighting for his survival, only differently.
Let the rich, if they are really serious push that strategic steps be taken to feed all the poor and constantly, not only once but twice at least.
But if they just keep crying stay at home, the poor may take the desperate mantra to mean- *die at home*

Bonny Light (Nigeria’s crude oil) is trading at about $11. This is half the cost of producing the barrel.
Even at that price, Nigeria is not able to sell her crude oil. She has tens of millions of barrels of crude oil in scores of vessels cruising the seas, like a gala seller in Lagos traffic, looking for customers.
No is calling; no one is buying. Nigeria is offering a $5 discount per barrel but who will buy when U.S. 🇺🇸 shale oil is selling for $2 (and no one is buying that either).
Nigeria 🇳🇬 has other bigger challenges because it does not have onshore crude oil storage so she has to put her oil on vessels.

It is a common myth that persons who have died of a communicable disease should be cremated, but this is not true. As of March 24, there is no evidence of persons having become infected from exposure to the bodies of persons who died from COVID-19.

The WHO further adds any body fluids leaking from orifices in the cadaver must be contained. There is no need to disinfect the body before transfer to the mortuary area.

People who have died from COVID-19 can be buried or cremated. However, WHO also mentioned that those who are constantly in contact with corpses may witness tuberculosis, bloodborne viruses (eg hepatitis B and C and HIV) and gastrointestinal infections.

Workers who routinely handle corpses may, however, risk contracting tuberculosis, bloodborne viruses (eg hepatitis B and C and HIV) and gastrointestinal infections (e.g. cholera, E. coli, hepatitis A, rotavirus diarrhoea, salmonellosis, shigellosis and typhoid/paratyphoid fevers)

*Introduction*
In the midst of the current panicking and fear of what may become of us owing to the ravaging effects of COVID-19, a lot of theories, conspiracies and prophecies so called have been flighted around. 

Vaccinations which will come together with ""electronic chips"" have been repeatedly pointed out by many as the envisaged *mark of the beast* spoken of in the 13th chapter of the book of Revelation.
 
It should be noted however that any interpretation of this chapter without proper identification of who/what the beast is, must be dismissed with contempt. 
In this series we are going to turn to the apocalyptic books of Daniel and Revelation and allow the Bible to reveal what the beast and its mark is.

I want to specially appreciate you for listening to the cries of the people and doing what we considered needful even as the Presidency had declared such actions (lockdown of States by State Governors) as illegal. A partial lockdown is necessary to enable us reduce the speed of the spread of this virus, we hope you will do the needful to gain the presidential permission to sustain the lockdown as it is for the best interest of our people. 

We are told we have 19 ventilators available in the State and we do hope the 19 are in working conditions. Well, we are also told by medical experts that 19 ventilators is way too small for a whole state. I want to believe you are doing something about that.

The governors, operating under the aegis of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), reached the agreement after receiving briefing from the Governors of Lagos, Bauchi, Oyo and Ogun States who shared their experiences and lessons from the fight against COVID-19.

A communiqe issued by the NGF chairman and governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, at the end of the sixth COVID-19 teleconference meeting said only essential services would be permitted.

State governors called for the decentralization of the COVID-19 response as the best chance of nipping the spread of the virus in communities with over 25 States now affected by the spread of the virus and increasing evidence of community transmission.

Montagnier’s claims come at a time when the US has alleged the possibility of the virus originating in a lab in China. The theory that COVID-19 was created in a Chinese lab and “leaked” out to the world has been making the rounds since its outbreak in December 2019. President Donald Trump also fired a fresh salvo when he warned China of consequences if it was “knowingly responsible” for the virus. China has refuted these allegations.
In an interview to a French news channel, Montagnier claimed that the virus, which causes the COVID-19 infection that is wreaking havoc around the world, was the result of an attempt to manufacture a vaccine against HIV in a Chinese lab.

We have all noticed recently that the heat of the day and the night was unbearably high. According to experts, this is due to the heat waves resulting from the emission of greenhouse gases.

This preparation will require smart coping strategies and participation in climate resilient practices to deal with the damage.
The common effects of heat waves on humans are dehydration that can lead to unconsciousness or death, chicken pox, heat rash, and psychological stress.
In order to cope with the current climatic conditions, the experts advised:
1. Drink more water to stay hydrated.
2. Keep a bottle of water with us to remind us to take water.
3. Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated beverages during this time.
4. Reduce the consumption of proteins rich foods (eg. red meats) as they increase metabolic heat.

This concept now must be your daily guiding thoughts on how to protect yourself when interacting with anybody outside your household especially neighbours. *Don't assume anybody is as sensible as you've been*. This is perhaps the only time, in modern history, to arrogantly consider yourself smarter than everyone around you, by judiciously doing *all you must* to stay safe.

Posted on 4/14/2020

Coronavirus Particles
One of the studies in the academic environment notes that “In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health. The immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections.” While expressing their interest through the Internet searches, it has emerged that people are posing various questions. The questions have specifically been premised on categories of people with immune systems capable of preventing the virus. The central question has been are black people immune to coronavirus? 

What is the Immune System?
The immune system is made up of specialized cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against attacks by “foreign” invaders called pathogens. These are primarily microbes (germs)—tiny, infection-causing organisms such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Because the human body provides an ideal environment for many microbe...",Genuine,Prevention,Broader societal effects

*2. Quarantine is pronounced KWO-RAN-TEEN, not KWO-RAN-TAIN, in both British and American English. In other words, quarantine rhymes with ""canteen,"" not ""valentine.""*
*3. Coronavirus is a single word, although “corona virus” is an acceptable variant.*
*4. People tend to use (“self-)quarantine” and “(self-)isolation” interchangeably, but they’re different.

“Hitherto, when your finger touched the screen of your smartphone and clicked on a link, the government wanted to know what exactly your finger was clicking on. But with coronavirus, the focus of interest shifts. Now the government wants to know the temperature of your finger and the blood-pressure under its skin.
 
One of the problems we face in working out where we stand on surveillance is that none of us know exactly how we are being surveilled, and what the coming years might bring.

Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

Maintain social distancing

Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

‘Going outdoors is what stops every respiratory disease’ - Knut Wittkowski.

A veteran scholar of epidemiology has warned that the ongoing lockdowns throughout the United States and the rest of the world are almost certainly just prolonging the coronavirus outbreak rather than doing anything to truly mitigate it.

Knut Wittkowski, previously the longtime head of the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at the Rockefeller University in New York City, said in an interview with the Press and the Public Project that the coronavirus could be “exterminated” if we permitted most people to lead normal lives and sheltered the most vulnerable parts of society until the danger had passed.

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

All perfect praise be to Allah, The Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad (Peace be upon him) is His servant and Messenger.

Dear brothers and sisters, here are some brief explanations on the regulations of Janazah due to COVID-19 Restrictions:

1. If you cannot perform ghusl (washing) of the deceased person due to the COVID-19 restrictions, then make tayammum (dry ablution or purification with earth) instead.

How to make tayammum: Strike the earth with both hands, wipe the face of the deceased, then his hands. Then shroud as normal with three large sheets, pray the janazah and bury. [See Majmu’u Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawwi’ah, vol. 13, page 123 of Shaikh Abdul-Aziz Bin Baz and Fatawa fi Ahkam Al-Jana’iz of Shaikh Muhammad Bin Salih Al-Uthaimin, page 213-214]

3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun. 

4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 

5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap. 

6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it. 

7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. 

8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on.

We do not have to wait until the end of coronavirus before we open our economy, if there is one thing coronavirus is leading us to is a new way of life, not the end of life. Now, it is time to design a new lifestyle and open the economy despite the presence of the virus, here is why and how. Closing a weak economy can lead to its ultimate death. The lockdown due to the coronavirus is tantamount to the absolute death of African economies that are largely comprised of small and informal enterprises. The economic repercussion of the lockdowns could be costlier than the virus itself. Locking down the economy will mean loss of income, jobs, and productivity, leading to extreme poverty, unemployment, and inflation. These economic issues can cause anarchy that might cost more lives and resources. The challenge is, how do we save these lives and resources in the presence of the deadly coronavirus.

7 Coronavirus Grammar Lessons By Farooq A. Kperogi, Ph.D.

I know grammar is the last thing on most people’s minds right now, but for the few people who care (and who have been sending me inquiries in private messages), here are seven coronavirus grammar lessons:

1. People test positive FOR coronavirus, not “TO” it. It is, “El-Rufai tests positive FOR coronavirus,” not “El-Rufai tests positive TO coronavirus.”

2. Quarantine is pronounced KWO-RAN-TEEN, not KWO-RAN-TAIN, in both British and American English. In other words, quarantine rhymes with ""canteen,"" not ""valentine.""

3. Coronavirus is a single word, although “corona virus” is an acceptable variant.

4. People tend to use (“self-)quarantine” and “(self-)isolation” interchangeably, but they’re different. You (self-)quarantine yourself when you suspect that you may have the disease because you have come in contact with people who have tested positive for it. You go into (self-)iso...",Parody,Public announcements,Psychological effects

Background
The science of the prevention and control of COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving, and many countries are adopting preventive measures based on emerging evidence and local applicability. One of such measures is the use of face masks to either protect uninfected persons from acquiring the infection or prevent infected persons from spreading it to others (otherwise called source control).
The Nigerian Centre of Disease Control (NCDC) recently released an advisory on the use of masks by members of the public without respiratory symptoms. It recommended wearing of face masks, (or equivalent) as an optional additional layer of protection to be used in addition to other measures such as physical distancing, hand and respiratory hygiene measures. Unfortunately, despite strong advice by the NCDC about the dangers of inappropriate use and disposal of face mask, it is observed that many Nigerians are misusing and abusing f...",Genuine,Face masks,Non-compliance with public health

BEWARE: Notice Circulating On Social Media Using Atiku Abubakar’s Name Is A Scam
Abuja, 02 April 2020: We wish to bring to the attention of Nigerians that former Vice President Atiku Abubakar is not connected to a certain notice circulating on social media directing unsuspecting members of the public to a link. We thus state categorically that any such link asking for the bio-data of Nigerians as beneficiaries of monetary handout is FAKE.
This is obviously a SCAM, an attempt to fleece and defraud Nigerians by, perhaps, collecting their vital bio-data for a nefarious objective orchestrated by masterminds of the advertisement on social media.
Atiku Abubakar, his businesses or charity organization is not in the know of this purported plan and the accompanying advertorial. The website address, https//www.atikufoundation.online, given by the scammers for individuals to apply, is unknown to the former Vice President.

COVID19.

Globally, there is ongoing debate on the effectiveness of masks as a preventive measure for the coronavirus disease. The evidence in favour of the use of masks includes the possibility of asymptomatic (a person never develops symptoms) and pre-symptomatic (before a person develops signsand symptoms) transmission and emerging evidence of the ability of a mask to prevent contact with respiratory droplets. Ecological comparisons also appear to suggest better outcomes in countries that have used masks as a general policy. Sources of concern have been that people who wear face masks may feel protected and ignore physical distancing advice. In addition, if face masks are not worn correctly, disposed of appropriately or if people touch their faces more frequently due to adjustments of the face masks they are wearing, they run a higher risk of infecting themselves.",Genuine,Face masks,Psychological effects

We do not have to wait until the end of coronavirus before we open our economy, if there is one thing coronavirus is leading us to is a new way of life, not the end of life. Now, it is time to design a new lifestyle and open the economy despite the presence of the virus, here is why and how. Closing a weak economy can lead to its ultimate death. The lockdown due to the coronavirus is tantamount to the absolute death of African economies that are largely comprised of small and informal enterprises. The economic repercussion of the lockdowns could be costlier than the virus itself. Locking down the economy will mean loss of income, jobs, and productivity, leading to extreme poverty, unemployment, and inflation. These economic issues can cause anarchy that might cost more lives and resources. The challenge is, how do we save these lives and resources in the presence of the deadly coronavirus.

Hello YALI Network members, I hope this message finds you and your families, friends, and communities safe and in good health. At this unprecedented time, I want you to know that the U.S. government is working around the clock to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The United States is deploying the full range of U.S. resources to contain COVID-19, not just at home, but also across the globe. Over the last 20 years, the United States has invested more than $100 billion to improve health care systems throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. These investments have saved lives and trained African health care providers to be better prepared for health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States continues to partner with the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and national public health institutions in Africa to support preparedness, and response to the ongoing global public health emergency that spread out of China and is now engulfing the world.

The CoronaVirus is now at the *community transmission* phase. It means that there are (unknown) infected persons within our neighborhoods that are now infecting other people. It means that they have the infection but not showing clinical symptoms. Here are my thoughts:
As we go forward, we must now *consider everybody around us as already infected*. This concept now must be your daily guiding thoughts on how to protect yourself when interacting with anybody outside your household especially neighbours. *Don't assume anybody is as sensible as you've been*. This is perhaps the only time, in modern history, to arrogantly consider yourself smarter than everyone around you, by judiciously doing *all you must* to stay safe.
This is also the time to begin to routinely wear *facemasks* as part of your clothing especially when stepping out of your house. * Disinfect facemask before & after use
* Wash hands regularly with soap + water despite use of facemask
* Use hand sanitizer despite use of facemask...",Genuine,Face masks,Broader societal effects

We had to track down this Manager to his village, where he had run to hide, after he fell ill with fever, Catarrh and dry Cough (similar to his Boss) he now got afraid enough to cooperate with us.

He was tested last Saturday, his results only came back to us yesterday.
We are now testing the Hotel Staff, mortician and morgue attendant as well as looking for the Cab-man.

The contacts of the Manager are so many that it's scary

*Are there any cases in Nigeria?*
Yes. Nigeria has recorded confirmed cases of COVID-19. A majority of the cases were imported from high risk countries with community transmission of COVID-19. Measures have been put in place to ensure all confirmed cases are isolated and receive treatment, while intense contact tracing is conducted.

*Can I visit a nearby health facility if I develop symptoms?*
No. It is important you stay indoors and avoid contact with everyone to limit the spread of the disease. The State Ministry of Health supported by NCDC will arrange for sample collection and transportation to the laboratory.

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, immediately contact your state hotline or NCDC on 07032864444 or 080097000010 (toll-free) for further guidance.

Why do you think the poor are unwilling to stay at home?
Is it because you think they want to die?
Let's open our understanding and analyze within proper context..
There are two issues now in Africa.
1. Health crises
2. Hunger crises
The rich are afraid of (1)
The poor are afraid of (2)
The rich are pushing the poor to stay at home as they who are rich believe that is what will save the situation and perhaps their ass as well.
The poor are also pushing to survive as they know they may die of hunger and not the virus if they don't take care.
The rich, it appears, fear the virus and not hunger.
The poor, it seems, fear hunger than the virus.
Each is fighting for his survival, only differently.
Let the rich, if they are really serious push that strategic steps be taken to feed all the poor and constantly, not only once but twice at least.
But if they just keep crying stay at home, the poor may take the desperate mantra to mean- *die at home*

Dear friends
Our Doctor who recovered from Corona illness and recovered in double quick time had inhaled Steam.
The doctors at IDH Corona centre too are continually inhaling steam.

Steaming raises the temperature of lungs, throat and mouth so that if the virus is already there it gets inactivate due to high temperature.

Yes that’s true as viruses sit in the throat first. 

That’s why even if there is someone sneezing in your office and you come home and inhale and gargle with warm water and salt, usually you will not get the flu. 

I recommend for everyone who is able to do it - 
1. Use steam inhalation everyday - morning and evening if possible,
2. Gargle with warm water and salt daily - morning and evening if possible.

This is a good daily practice which will improve your overall well-being and can be continued even after COVID19 ends.

According to a press release by NAFDAC, which was necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, measures to ensure access to health commodities that have the potential to impact positively on public health outcomes have been put in place. One of such measures is the diagnostics necessary to support public health infrastructures and guide the management of the disease and to fight its outbreak.

Why do you think the poor are unwilling to stay at home?
Is it because you think they want to die?
Let's open our understanding and analyze within proper context..
There are two issues now in Africa.
1. Health crises
2. Hunger crises
The rich are afraid of (1)
The poor are afraid of (2)
The rich are pushing the poor to stay at home as they who are rich believe that is what will save the situation and perhaps their ass as well.
The poor are also pushing to survive as they know they may die of hunger and not the virus if they don't take care.
The rich, it appears, fear the virus and not hunger.
The poor, it seems, fear hunger than the virus.
Each is fighting for his survival, only differently.
Let the rich, if they are really serious push that strategic steps be taken to feed all the poor and constantly, not only once but twice at least.
But if they just keep crying stay at home, the poor may take the desperate mantra to mean- *die at home*

Here are my thoughts:

As we go forward, we must now *consider everybody around us as already infected*. This concept now must be your daily guiding thoughts on how to protect yourself when interacting with anybody outside your household especially neighbours. *Don't assume anybody is as sensible as you've been*. This is perhaps the only time, in modern history, to arrogantly consider yourself smarter than everyone around you, by judiciously doing *all you must* to stay safe.

Impact of Covid-19 on Nigeria

Nigeria, like all the nations of the world, is navigating uncertain times. However, for Nigeria, as an oil-dependent economy, this is a Twin Shock: COVID-19 Pandemic Global & Domestic Shock, and Oil Price Shock.

Nigeria’s vulnerabilities to the impact of these external shocks can be adduced to increased dependencies on global economies for fiscal revenues, foreign exchange inflows, fiscal deficit funding and capital flows required to sustain the nation’s economic activities.

This indication emerged on Sunday when the Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Udoh, in a statement, disclosed the COVID-19 team is embarking on aggressive testing.

Udoh urged residents of the state to cooperate and offer themselves for testing even if they were yet to display symptoms of COVID -19.

According to him, the outcome of mass and aggressive testing would be “a prelude to considering whether the domestic economy would be reopened after the one week lockdown extension"".

A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus.
The disease caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’

Ist hand information
Dear friends
Our Doctor who recovered from Corona illness and recovered in double quick time had inhaled Steam.
The doctors at IDH Corona centre too are continually inhaling steam.

Steaming raises the temperature of lungs, throat and mouth so that if the virus is already there it gets inactivate due to high temperature.

Yes that’s true as viruses sit in the throat first. 

That’s why even if there is someone sneezing in your office and you come home and inhale and gargle with warm water and salt, usually you will not get the flu. 

I recommend for everyone who is able to do it - 
1. Use steam inhalation everyday - morning and evening if possible,
2. Gargle with warm water and salt daily - morning and evening if possible.

This is a good daily practice which will improve your overall well-being and can be continued even after COVID19 ends.

By Dr. John U. Osonwa Ninth, as lockdown continues in our major cities, expect a rise in insecurity. Incidents of armed robbery, home invasion, theft, rape, and kidnapping are being reported now and are likely to increase exponentially in the coming weeks, if the lockdown measures are extended. We are already seeing the breakdown of law and order in Lagos and other parts of the Southwest, probably because they went into lockdown before other zones. As the hydra-headed monsters of idleness and financial hardship bite, we are likely to see an upsurge in youth restiveness and criminality in many zones. Given that Nigeria's COVID-19 burden is still growing at an alarming rate, we are now caught between the proverbial rock and the hard place. That is another storm on the horizon.

Nigeria is offering a $5 discount per barrel but who will buy when U.S. shale oil is selling for $2 (and no one is buying that either). Nigeria has other bigger challenges because it does not have onshore crude oil storage so she has to put her oil on vessels.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
1. Corona is a large virus. The diameter of the virus is 400-500 micro, so that any type of mask can prevent entry into our bodies and does not need to use expensive masks.
2. Corona virus does not float in the air, but sticks to objects, so that transmission is not through the air.
3. When attached to a metal surface, the corona virus can live for 12 hours. Washing hands with soap and water is enough.
4. When attached to a cloth, the corona virus can live for 9
hours, so washing clothes or drying it in the sun for 2 hours is enough to kill it.
5. When attached to the hand, the corona virus can live for 10 minutes, so that it provides an alcohol-based _sterilizer_enough to be on guard.
6. When in the air at temperatures 26-27 ° C, the corona virus will die so it does not live in hot areas. In addition, drinking hot water and basking in the sun is enough as a precaution.

Governors of the 36 States of the federation on Wednesday “unanimously” agreed to the implementation of an inter-State lockdown in the country over the next two weeks to mitigate the spread of the pandemic COVID-19 virus from State to State.

The governors, operating under the aegis of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), reached the agreement after receiving briefing from the Governors of Lagos, Bauchi, Oyo and Ogun States who shared their experiences and lessons from the fight against COVID-19.

A communiqe issued by the NGF chairman and governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, at the end of the sixth COVID-19 teleconference meeting said only essential services would be permitted.

State governors called for the decentralization of the COVID-19 response as the best chance of nipping the spread of the virus in communities with over 25 States now affected by the spread of the virus and increasing evidence of community transmission.

Why do you think the poor are unwilling to stay at home?
Is it because you think they want to die?
Let's open our understanding and analyze within proper context..
There are two issues now in Africa.
1. Health crises
2. Hunger crises
The rich are afraid of (1)
The poor are afraid of (2)
The rich are pushing the poor to stay at home as they who are rich believe that is what will save the situation and perhaps their ass as well.
The poor are also pushing to survive as they know they may die of hunger and not the virus if they don't take care.
The rich, it appears, fear the virus and not hunger.
The poor, it seems, fear hunger than the virus.
Each is fighting for his survival, only differently.
Let the rich, if they are really serious push that strategic steps be taken to feed all the poor and constantly, not only once but twice at least.
But if they just keep crying stay at home, the poor may take the desperate mantra to mean- *die at home*
We are each others keeper.

My neighbor's son sustained a head injury while playing with his fellow kids and was rushed to the general hospital in my area here.

The little boy wasn't sick o.
Just a head injury that happened in my presence while we were outside discussing. 

On Sunday, I went to check on the boy to see how he was doing, he was already playing with other kids though his head is still bandaged. 

I started talking with his mom and she told me what now seems to be the new trend as regards Covid-19 in Nigeria. 

She showed me the receipt issued to her by the hospital. 
It was marked Covid-19, case 353.

I was surprised to see that. 

She said when she saw the receipt, she asked the nurse what was the meaning of that? 
That her son isn't a Covid-19 patient. 

The nurse told her not to worry, that it means nothing.

Dear friends
Our Doctor who recovered from Corona illness and recovered in double quick time had inhaled Steam.
The doctors at IDH Corona centre too are continually inhaling steam.

Steaming raises the temperature of lungs, throat and mouth so that if the virus is already there it gets inactivate due to high temperature.

Yes that’s true as viruses sit in the throat first. 

That’s why even if there is someone sneezing in your office and you come home and inhale and gargle with warm water and salt, usually you will not get the flu. 

I recommend for everyone who is able to do it - 
1. Use steam inhalation everyday - morning and evening if possible,
2. Gargle with warm water and salt daily - morning and evening if possible.

This is a good daily practice which will improve your overall well-being and can be continued even after COVID19 ends.

Please also pass this information for the benefit of others.

Yesterday(22/04/2020), I read that about 25% percent of those with Covid-19 in Nigeria have no travel history or contact with infected persons. That's according to the NCDC.
Now this is possible, it was first observed in Italy, and later in the US.
You can be locked in at home, and the virus still meet you there. One means by which that can happen is MONEY, cash! Yea, long ago during one of my safety trainings, I learnt that money(cash) is the most exposed 'entity' in the universe. That money in your hand, depending on how long it has been in circulation, most likely has traveled more than you. So even before Covid-19, I had learnt to wash my hands after every contact with cash. This is difficult, but I have done it for over 6years now and it has become part of me.

According to the guard's description, two or three of them were wearing PPE, masks and gloves, and two in army uniform. They also wore masks and gloves. Though the guard was a bit shaken, he made it clear to them that the landlord himself would have to tell him to open the gate. If they really have to take a corona patient, they have to wait outside till the morning. As the guard did not open the gate, they said they would come back later in the morning.

📝 A QUESTION PEOPLE OFTEN ASK 📝
How/Why Do People Recover If There's Still No Proven Cure For COVID-19?
_________________________
📢 ANSWER :
Most respiratory viruses-- including Corona viruses such as the ones that causes the Common Cold -- are self-limiting, so to say.
What this means is that they have a relatively finite period in the human body before they ""wear themselves out,"" or the immune system contains them, and the sufferer recovers.
Treatment for these viruses is thus mostly aimed at;

Their conviction thus made them interestingly one of the very few known Coronavirus-related convictions in the world. Despite Nigeria being minimally affected by the pandemic, Nigeria led the world in criminally convicting a celebrity couple and threatening to convict others out of the same event. Nigeria is a wonderful country when it comes to the negative use of law.

*4. People tend to use (“self-)quarantine” and “(self-)isolation” interchangeably, but they’re different.

The governors of the 36 states in Nigeria have agreed to have the country locked down for the next two weeks to mitigate spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

Fayemi said that the call was imperative with over 25 states now affected by spread of the virus and increasing evidence of community transmission.

 *Myth* 😷:A face mask will protect you from COVID-19.

 *Fact* : Certain models of professional, tight-fitting respirators (such as the N95) can protect health care workers as they care for infected patients.
For the general public without respiratory illness, wearing lightweight disposable surgical masks is not recommended. Because they don’t fit tightly, they may allow tiny infected droplets to get into the nose, mouth or eyes.
People with a respiratory illness can wear these masks to lessen their chance of infecting others. 

 *Myth* : Ordering or buying products shipped from China will make a person sick.😏

 *Fact* :scientists have noted that most viruses like this one do not stay alive for very long on surfaces, so it is not likely you would get COVID-19 from a package that was in transit for days or weeks. The illness is most likely transmitted by droplets from an infected person’s sneeze or cough.
