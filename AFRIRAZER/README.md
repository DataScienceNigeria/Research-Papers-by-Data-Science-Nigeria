# AFRIRAZER: A Deep Learning Model to remove Background and Skin from Traditional African Fashion Images ([paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346418890_AFRIRAZER_A_Deep_Learning_Model_to_remove_Background_and_Skin_from_Traditional_African_Fashion_Images))
AFRIRAZER is a deep learning model for background and skin removal in African fashion images. While the concept of image segmentation using deep learning for fashion is not new, traditional African images are not well represented in the common fashion training images. This work is part of a larger ongoing project on the curation of clean, de-identiﬁed and applicable traditional African fashion for Artiﬁcial Intelligence related work.

With as little as 512 training images, the model successfully removed image background and with increased training data, there was a signiﬁcant performance improvement in removing skin and outlining dresses from images.

## Framework
The model was trained with the architecture below for 100 epochs with train-test split size of 8:2
